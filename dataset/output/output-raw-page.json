Whether creating a beautiful outdoor entertainment space or simply adding value to your property, you want to be sure you’re making the right choice when investing in a deck. With so many decking timbers and materials available, it can be overwhelming to choose. Selecting the best timber for your deck will come down to personal preferences such as desired aesthetic, lifestyle, and budget.",

      "A classic Kiwi decking timber, our locally sourced pine is a budget-friendly option that requires an annual clean plus sanding and staining every 1-2 years. You can expect your pine deck to last around 15 years with regular maintenance. Available in two grades, ‘merch pine’ and ‘premium pine’, this timber is a light tan colour that will weather off to silver or is easily stained. Pine timber features knots - naturally occurring imperfections in the wood grain – and is prone to contracting and expanding with changing temperatures.",
      "Modified Pine such as Abodo Vulcan, and Accoya are alternatives to traditional pine that have been treated to make this timber as durable as hardwoods. More resistant to cracking and warping, these products are easily maintained with an annual clean and do not require re-painting or staining. Abodo Vulcan is avaialble in a dark brown, and Accoya is grey. Read on for further information on each option.",
      "Hardwood timbers such as kwila, kwila ShadowDeck, garapa, vitex, and purpleheart are sourced from responsibly managed tropical forests worldwide. Dense, durable, and water-resistant, these timbers are low maintenance, only requiring cleaning every 1-2 years. Whilst kwila and kwila ShadowDeck are red-brown and will ‘bleed’ colour, garapa, vitex, and purpleheart do not leach, so they may be more suitable depending on your outdoor living design. For more on each timber, read on.",
      "The technology of composite decking has advanced significantly over the last decade. An alternative to timber, these products are typically made of recycled wood fibre and recycled plastic or polyethylene. Highly durable and almost maintenance-free, composite provides a timber look and feel with various finishes available. While the initial investment can be more expensive than traditional timber, a composite deck will pay itself off within a few years due to its low maintenance.

      "Buy all your pavers from one place and from the same batch if possible, to avoid differences in colour that can result from different batches. If you can’t buy all in one batch, mix the pavers up before laying. Please note: pavers may also displa \na “whitening” otherwise known as efflorescence effect. This is a characteristic of many masonry products and does diminish over time. If you have any trouble working out the quantities of each paver you need, PlaceMakers offers a free estimation service.",
      "Like any building job, you’ve got to get the foundations right. Extensive areas of paving, particularly where large areas of soft topsoil have to be dug out, require large volumes of materials. There are four main materials:",
      "On smaller sites, piles of materials can crowd the area you want to pave. If that’s the case, take delivery of the later stage materials only as you are ready to use them. That means digging out and laying the base course material first, then get the bedding sand and pavers delivered.",
      "Weight of trafficSome pavers can only withstand pedestrian use. Others will take light vehicle\ntraffic. Even stronger pavers will handle heavy vehicles. Check the specifications with PlaceMakers.",
      "Paver shape and sizeYour choice should suit the size and shape of the area being paved. Laying pattern: Again, this should suit the area being paved. Laying options include: 45 degree herringbone, stretcherbond, basketweave, soldier courses along the edges",
      "Check the manufacturer’s recommendations.",
      "A.Determine the finished level of the highest part of your paving. Against buildings, that should be at least 150mm below the level of concrete floors, \nor below the ground level under timber floors. From there, your paving should slope between 15mm to 30mm per metre away from the building.\nThis prevents puddling or running under buildings.",
      "B.Dig out the area to be paved to the combined depth of the three layers, i.e.\npavers depth plus bedding sand and base course depths.",
      "Even after excavating, the sub-grade might have holes that need filling to bring it up to the desired level. Fill these with base material, and compact in layers no more than 100mm thick using a plate compactor or a rammer for small areas. Thorough compaction is vital especially at edges. The finished sub-grade level should be within 20mm of the contour of the finished paving.",
      "This should also be laid in layers no thicker than 100mm and compacted to a uniform dense condition, especially around manholes and kerbs. The finished texture of the base course should not allow bedding sand to filter through. The final surface of the base course should match the contour of your finished paving with no bumps, and no holes deeper than 10mm.",
      "Edging is important to prevent sideways movement of pavers, and to stop bedding sand leaking out.",
      "Edging options",
      "Bedding sand supports your pavers, but will not hide irregularities in the base course. It should be coarse river sand (not beach sand), and damp but not wet.",
      "If you have already laid a Soldier or Kerb course, you may be able to use that to support your runners. If the area to be paved is too wide you’ll need to drive pegs, and fix your runners to them, just like concrete boxing (see below).",
      "Your pavers now need to be consistently compacted over the whole area. Include a minimum of three passes with compactor each at 90 degrees to each other.",
      "In most cases maintenance will be minimal. If some pavers settle unevenly, or if underground services need to be exposed, your paving may require re-laying. To do this simply follow the procedures given above. It would pay to add a layer of weed matting below the sand layer to stop any weeds that could grow up and between your pavers. Where paving is cleaned or has water running across it the joint sand may require topping up periodically. To enhance the appearance of your paving special sealers are available. These may require reapplication over time. Ask at your PlaceMakers Firth Centre.",
      "NOTE: Building or landscaping work may have to comply with the New Zealand Building Code and your local Council requirements. Talk to the building inspectors at your council. They can provide helpful details of such matters and say whether or not a permit is required for the work you wish to do.",
      "Take note of potential problems such as drains, trees and electrical wiring.",
      "Check the height of the surface to be paved, take measurements and draw plans. Set the paving below the fl oor level and slightly sloped away from the house, or areas that you would want to keep water away from.",
      "Choose your pavers and design, measure up and order.",
      "If the ground is firm and well compacted excavate to a depth of 75mm, then move to next step. If soft or a fi lled site, excavate 75-100mm deeper and add 75-100mm of top course and compact well with a plate compactor.",
      "Now set up string-lines to give you lines to follow for both height and gapping.",
      "NB:It is critical to allow a minimum gap of 8mm between pavers, although a 10mm to 15mm gap is recommended.",
      "This gap allows you to have some fl exibility if there are any minor height discrepancies and also removes the effect of any slight size variations that may occur in hand made pavers.",
      "Some pavers may need cutting. You can hire a suitable saw from hire centres or use an angle grinder with a masonry blade. Always read and familiarise yourself with the operating instructions of any machinery used and take all safety precautions.",
      "Hose off pavers, let them dry, then use either pave joint sand, mortar pointing, or pavelock grouting sand. It is important to follow the product directions. If compaction is required, go over pavers with a rubber mallet.",
      "Use dry sand and cement mix to trowel an edge from the top of the paver, away at a\n45 degree angle to give the pavers a border, or haunch, to hold them in place.",

      "Our team has everything you need to get your retaining work done right the first time. With a great range of options and expert advice, we can help you turn the serious business of retaining into something strong and beautiful.",
      "The main purpose of retaining walls is to hold back soil and prevent erosion. You can also use retaining walls to create level surfaces or terraces, provide structural stability and improve the overall aesthetics of your property. The main materials for retaining walls include timber, sleepers, retaining blocks, masonry, and galvanised wire (gabion) baskets filled with stones.",
      "Before you start, it's important to know that in New Zealand any retaining walls over 1.5 metres high require building consent from your local council. Some walls lower than 1.5 metres that carry extra loading such, as  driveway, building, or steep slope also require building consent. If you're in any doubt, we recommend consulting your local council for advice.",
      "We have a retaining solution for every home with our comprehensive range of materials",
      "Explore now:",
      "Timber's natural good looks make it a popular material for retaining walls. You can use timber retaining to create a focal point in your garden, highlight a special feature, or level off areas to create a flat lawn.",
      "Wooden sleepers are naturally durable and can be used for retaining walls, raised garden beds, pathways, steps, water features, or even furniture. Check out our wide range of new and reclaimed sleepers including Pine, Macrocarpa, hardwood, and Oak.",
      "Retaining blocks come in a mix of quarried stone and earth-tone colours which allow them to naturally blend in with any landscape. You can use blocks to create low-level retaining walls, tree rings, planters, and raised garden beds or to finish your lawn edge in style.",
      "Gabion baskets are galvanised wire containers that you can fill with almost anything you want — rocks, straw, tiles, bricks, or grass! Gabions can be linked together to form structures that drain well and help to stabilise your soil. They look great as retaining walls or can be used to create feature objects in your garden.",
      "Retaining walls in New Zealand must comply with local building codes and regulations, which specify requirements for design, construction, and safety. This will include factors such as the height of the wall, soil conditions, drainage, and earthquake considerations. It’s important to consult with a qualified engineer or landscape professional before you start to ensure all retaining walls are safe, structurally sound, and comply with local regulations.",
      "While the whole wall must be strong, it’s the part below ground that anchors it. If your footings or foundations are weak, there is nothing to stop a retaining wall from falling over.",
      "You need to understand the soil properties behind and below your retaining wall. Soil type, moisture content and bearing capacity should determine the design and materials required for your retaining wall.",
      "Proper drainage is important to prevent water build-up which can cause structural failure. Drainage systems such as weep holes, gravel backfill, and geotextile fabrics may need to be incorporated into your design.",
      "Slopes that are prone to erosion, landslides, or other natural forces may require additional stabilization measures such as geogrids or soil reinforcement.",

      "Kiwis love outdoor living, and a pergola can extend your deck to enhance your home. A pergola frames your space, makes a statement, and can provide year-round protection - as well as lots of entertaining possibilities. Wooden pergolas can also be used in landscaping to form a shaded pathway or to support vines or roses. To protect your outdoor space in all weather, your pergola can be turned into a veranda with translucent roofing to allow the light in and the rain out. Flat or corrugated, these lightweight roofing systems bring years of outdoor enjoyment while protecting your family from New Zealand’s harmful UV rays.",

      "Painting the exterior of your house can take a number of weeks to complete. Because of this it is recommended that you prepare and paint only one side of the house at a time. Preparation is the key to any good paint job so no task should be overlooked when preparing your\nhouse for painting (refer to our Know How brochure Preparing to Paint).",
      "The paint work must be in good, sound condition, with no rusty areas, peeling or flaking paint. It must be free from contaminants such as mould, lichen, mildew and any other contaminant that will affect the adhesion of the new paint.",
      "Salt deposits from coastal environments, \n industrial fallout and aeroplane contaminants must all be treated to remove. To extend the life of your painted finish it is advisable to wash down the outside of your house on a regular basis – once a year. This removes ingrained\ncontaminants from the paint work that slowly wear away the surface coating, resulting in premature failure.",
      "1. Tools2. Preparation",
      "Water blasting the exterior timber is not advisable as it can damage softer timbers and force water into the fibres, resulting in the possibility of cracked and warped surfaces.",
      "Wash the exterior surfaces with sugar soap to remove the contaminants and flush with plenty of fresh water. It is advisable to wash small areas at a time to avoid the wash solution drying which then makes it difficult to remove.",
      "Mould can be a major issue with some houses, especially on the southern side of the house. This should be treated with the appropriate mould remover/killer prior to preparation.",
      "Loose, flaking and cracked paint should be completely removed to avoid adhesion problems later in the paint’s life. Check all areas of the paint work for peeling. A simple test to check for adhesion is to put an X cut in the paint work with a sharp knife. Put a piece of sticky tape over the cut, sticking down well, and pull the tape off. If any paint comes off then the area will have to be stripped back to a sound surface.",
      "A)Check to see if your old paint is in good condition by making several cuts with a sharp knife or razor blade.",
      "B)Press a piece of strong adhesive tape across the area and peel it off.",
      "C)If the paint comes off with the tape, the surface should be stripped, sanded or scraped back to bare wood if possible.",
      "Sand the surface well, this helps the new paint to adhere.",
      "Any nails that have been exposed should be punched below the surface and it is advisable to prime with an anti-corrosive metal primer to avoid rust staining. This is also advisable if you have sanded any metal soakers (timber jointers) or any other steel surfaces prone to rust. If rust is evident, wire brush to remove as much rust as possible and treat with a metal prep prior to priming with your anticorrosive metal primer. All holes should be filled with appropriate exterior filler, then sanded when dry and primed/undercoated.",
      "If there is any possibility of the tannin timber treatment bleeding through light coloured acrylic finishes, it is advisable to prime using an oil-based wood primer.",
      "Fibre-cement or concrete finishes should be washed with an appropriate cleaner prior to repainting with your 100% acrylic finish. A minimum of 2 coats is required.",
      "Window frames that have had the putty dry and fall out should be reputtied. Remove all the old putty and clean the surface well so it’s free from contaminants. Prime the surface with oil-based wood primer and allow to dry. Once this has dried you can apply new putty, which should be left for approximately 3 weeks prior to painting. The reason for priming prior to applying the putty is that the oil in the putty will absorb into the woodwork, and the putty will dry out and fall out again.",
      "Most roofs will have some corrosion to deal with. Avoid water blasting, and make sure the surface is sound with no rust present. Wash the roof down with sugar soap, covering a small area at a time, and then flush off with fresh water until all areas are clean and free from contaminants. If there is rust, sand the affected areas and treat with the appropriate kill rust primer. Prime any bare areas with Galvanised Iron Primer and once dry, apply two finish coats of roof paint (minimum 2 hours between coats at 20°C and 65% humidity).",
      "With the amount of work involved in preparing the exterior for painting, it is recommended that you purchase the best possible product for the job to avoid disappointment later when the ‘cheaper’ paint starts to fail. Refer to our Know How brochures Selecting the Right Roller, Selecting the Right Brush and Choosing the Right Paint to help you get the best result.",
      "Once you have chosen your final colour, purchase all the paint at the same time and box (mix) all the containers of the same colour together to eliminate the colour variation that can occur within paints.",
      "The final topcoat that provides the perfect colour and finish is only part of a system of paints and preparations working as a team. Some paints are a simple system comprising two or three coats of the same paint. Paint intended for bare woodwork or metalwork often needs a more complex system, using paints with different qualities.",
      "Check with your local PlaceMakers and/or consult paint manufacturer’s brochures to select the right system for your needs.",
      "The paint can label holds vital information about how to apply the paint, as well as which undercoats and primers are compatible. Read it carefully and follow the instructions exactly. If you want clarification, ask PlaceMakers.",
      "Before starting, check the weather. Avoid painting in both very hot (more than 27˚C) or very cold (less than 10˚C) conditions. Fog or dusty conditions should also be avoided. Plan to finish painting at least two hours before sundown. Dew fall, as well as rain, can damage the paint.",
      "As a general rule, the parts of the house should be painted in this order:",
      "1. Roof.Apply the necessary primers or undercoats as directed by the instructions on the can for the finishing coat. Paint all the ridge, hip and valley flashings by brush and then fill the large areas with a roller for corrugated steel. Check the paint around nail and screw heads and touch up by brush where necessary.",
      "2. Eaves and verandah ceilings soffits.Paint all the barge and fascia boards and then the soffits. If your spouting is snapfastened PVC, removing the spouting can make painting the fascia much easier.",
      "3. Walls.Start at the highest point and paint the full length of the wall. Work down the wall, painting in wide vertical strips making sure you brush back into the wet edge of the previous strip. Then go back to the top and lightly run over the newly painted area with your brush to ensure even coverage and a smooth finish. For weatherboards, start at the top of the wall. Paint one or two boards at a time. Paint the under edge first, then the face of the boards working across then down.",
      "4. Windows.Either cut in around the glass with a cutting in brush, or mask the glass.",
      "5. Doors.Paint the edges first then apply paint to the face of the door, starting at the top. If the door has a moulding, paint the moulding first then do the remainder of the panels. If the door has a threshold, do that last.",
      "Dip no more than the first third of the brush into the paint, wiping off the excess on either side of the paint container, (not the rim) to prevent drips.",
      "When using acrylic paint, brushes and rollers should be washed out regularly to maintain paint flow.",
      "Apply a strip of masking tape around the perimeter of the glass, 2 or 3mm from the frame, allowing a narrow strip of painted glass to provide a weather seal.",
      "Remove the masking tape as the paint starts to dry and it will come away without tearing the paint film.",

      "When things are set in stone, they really do last forever. Our natural stone pavers are made from the world’s abundant resources of porcelain, sandstone, and granite. Our porcelain is fired in super-hot furnaces, our handcrafted sandstone sourced from remote mines, and our granite is carved from giant blocks in quality-controlled quarries.",
      "Each paver is unique, some will have hairline cracks as part of their character. Others will have texture and natural blemishes from the way the rock has been split or fired. The result is timeless beauty. Paving that has subtle tones of colour that blend into the landscape and add substance to any home.",
      "Find a store near you",
      "Forget any notion that porcelain is fragile. These beautiful pavers are engineered from natural porcelain, compressed and fired in kilns to make them hard as nails. Porcelain paving is incredibly dense and therefore extremely hard-wearing and stain resistant. If your patio is your party place, then porcelain will take everything you can throw at it, and more.",

      "Managing stormwater runoff around your property is an important and responsible action to take - especially with the increase of intensified urbanisation over recent decades. Reducing the impact on our stormwater infrastructure during severe weather events and allowing natural aquifers to recharge can be achieved in several different ways under council unitary plans. The most practical option for medium-to-high-density environments is an engineered permeable paving system which reduces the need for other retention structures such as ponds, swales, and sumps.",
      "Permeable paving creates a hardscape that allows water to flow through the enlarged gaps between the pavers (like the Firth Holland 80 FlowPave) or through an open paver design (like Firth Grass pavers) into an engineered drainage or retention system below.",
      "As water passes through the pavers, base course, and sub-base materials, there are two main benefits: the rate at which runoff enters our stormwater systems is greatly slowed, reducing the chances of them being completely overwhelmed, creating localised flooding problems. The second is the quality of the runoff water is greatly improved through filtering and sedimentation of any pollutants, so they are not discharging into streams and coastal waters causing erosion problems.",
      "For effective stormwater management, a permeable paving system must be installed and correctly designed/engineered by a suitably qualified person.",
      "Find a store near you",
      "Firth’s EcoPave range offers an extensive choice of permeable pavers. Available in a variety of styles, colours, and specific uses, they help manage stormwater flows around your property while creating practical and good-looking hardscapes that will last for years.",
      "Horizon’s Wai Pave permeable pavers offer an innovative solution to managing stormwater. Rainwater can pass through the pavers at a rate of 660mm per hour with zero runoff.",

      "Firth Gobi® Block is a robust paver that’s ideal for high traction requirements where a semi-grassed look is desired, such as hardstands for boats and caravans, sloping driveways, and access tracks. The open design allows grass to grow through for a more natural-looking surface while allowing water to drain into natural aquifers.",
      "If you want to maintain a grass look, but have the underlying strength of a paved surface, then Firth Grass Pavers are the ideal solution. Their wide openings allow a good amount of grass to grow through and water to filter through to drainage.",
      "These stylish square pavers have enlarged nibs to create gaps and enable stormwater to drain efficiently. This paver is available with two finish options: honed (premium semi-polished) and fair face (standard higher-tractions finish). This paver is available in theNorth Island onlyand needs to be laid by an accredited paver.",
      "A variant of the popular Firth Holland paver but with enlarged edge nibs for high permeability rates, the Firth Holland 80 FlowPave is ideal for driveways, paths, and areas where water run-off control is needed. This product uses chip for both bedding and jointing material (not sand).",
      "A variant of the popular Firth Holland paver but with enlarged nibs for high permeability rates and a halved face for a traditional street cobble effect, the Firth Holland 80 FlowPave Set is ideal for driveways, paths, and areas where run-off control is needed. This product uses chip for both bedding and jointing materials (not sand).",
      "The Firth Holland PorousPave has a high traction surface and standard edge nibs giving a patio or path a more seamless look while helping to manage water run-off. Unlike other EcoPave products the water can pass directly through the paver due to the specially designed no-fines concrete formulation giving it an open aggregate matrix (similar to a sponge).",
      "WaiPave is a sustainable answer to water runoff made from recycled porcelain floor tiles. Rainwater can pass through WaiPavers at a rate of up to 660mm/hour with zero runoff. Colourfast and strong, WaiPave is a circular solution for the environment.",

      "Decorative stones are not only a chemical free way of suppressing weeds, they are also an excellent way of protecting your plants and trees. River pebbles reduce the harsh impact of the weather, protecting roots, retaining moisture, and reflecting heat. They also add a layer of insulation which can protect your plants in winter.",
      "Stone chips, on the other hand, are an economical way of creating a traditional driveway with the angular stone chips fitting together tightly to create strength and stability.

Whether they’re used as retaining timber, formed into steps to make use of uneven ground, crafted into durable outdoor furniture, used as garden edging or in decorative raised gardens, wooden sleepers are a landscaper’s best friend. No other timber can match the look and appearance, plus sleepers are hard-wearing and can last decades with only minimal maintenance.",

Some considerations to make when selecting a particular type of timber sleeper includes the available lengths and dimensions available, whether your sleepers will be used in a structural or garden application, and whether you’re after a clean or rustic look for your project.",

      "Do you dream of a level lawn, terraces rather than slopes, a safe flat play area, raised garden beds, or a sheltered patio with an attractive backdrop? If so, our choice of timber retaining walls could be just what you need to transform your outdoor space. Re-imagining your garden in layers, with creative changes in level, could help you to reclaim unloved spaces, maximise natural height, and provide welcome areas of shade and privacy.",
      "Our pre-treated timber walls are both functional and decorative. We use only plantation-grown radiata pine, which is environmentally sustainable and prepped for ground contact, making it ideally suited to the job. Our retaining walls can be used to realise a huge variety of projects from raised flower beds to enclosed outdoor dining areas, sunken gardens to terraced lawns that the whole family can enjoy.",
      "Note: A retaining wall needs to work hard to keep the soil where you want it to stay. So please be aware that any steep banks, waterlogged ground, or heavy load-bearing walls will need firm footings with good drainage and may require specialist advice and council planning consent before you start work. We recommend reading ourGuide to Building Retaining Wallswhich includes notes on building consents and the retaining wall fundamentals.",
      "We supply three types of retaining timber to suit a wide range of landscaping projects and styles:Rough Sawn,Tongue and Groove, andSureWall. The latest SureWall design uses a clever sliding interlocking system which is quick and easy to install for a neat and contemporary finish. Any low retaining wall could also be turned into bench seating or topped with one of our attractive trellis or decorative landscaping screens for a taste of inspirational outdoor living.",

Scaled down for domestic landscaping, a gabion basket brings contemporary styling to a garden design whilst also affordable and highly functional as a retaining wall with bench-seating options.",
      "Using galvanised steel wire to ensure longevity, our gabion cages come in three sizes to suit a range of garden projects from low-level walls to taller structures, creating a striking backdrop for an outdoor dining area, property boundary, or terraced sun deck.",
      "Our gabions come pre-filled, or you can fill them with your choice of rocks or a mix of aggregates for a layered effect. We recommend our gabion or river rocks for durability and industrial aesthetic appeal, but you can stack them with bricks (whole or broken), tiles, or even coloured glass stones for a dramatic feature that will come alive at night with LED lighting.",
      "As a bold garden design tool, they can be planted to create a colourful living wall, raised flower bed or attractive lawn edging or, if non-retaining, used to shape hedging or filled with tall grasses to create natural geometrical structures in your garden. Why not alternate rock-filled gabions with evergreen-planted ones for a truly eye-catching feature wall. Your imagination is the only limit! See ourPlaceMakers Landscaping Guidefor more advice on their use and construction.",
      "A cost-effective solution, our gabion baskets are easy to install and low maintenance. The 4mm wire mesh grids of 75mm x 75mm squares redistribute forces evenly, so a slope or soil bank can be retained and stabilised. The natural spaces between the rocks allow water to drain freely, and the wires are galvanised to ensure the baskets remain rust-resistant. The lower height options can be topped with lengths of timber decking to create an attractive garden bench whilst the higher baskets can be fitted with outdoor lighting to illuminate a patio. There is the option to mix and match different-sized gabions to suit your project.",

      "Pergolas are one of the oldest forms of architectural structures, the earliest can be traced back to Egyptian times to the gardens of Thebes. While uses have changed over time, pergolas are still a popular way to add structure and shade to gardens and homes, and to add a touch of class. Consisting of pillars and cross beams, pergolas have evolved from the large stone pillars of ancient times to more simplistic, stylish designs that can protect and extend your outdoor enjoyment, year-round.",
      "Whether free-standing or attached to your building, pergolas can be built from a range of materials to create a look that matches your home or landscape. Wooden pergolas are the natural place to start, and Kiwis have an abundance of choices. From NZ-grown radiata pine, engineered pine, or rustic Macrocarpa, to hardwoods like Kwila, or recycled hardwood rail sleepers. Modern homes might opt for an aluminium pergola which can be powder-coated to match the home and provides a lighter, easy maintenance solution.",

      "New Zealand radiata pine is an economical option and treated H4 or H5 for durability. Radiata is easy to work with and is relatively light. It will last, but expect some natural cracking or warping over the years. Leave it to naturally fade or paint or stain.",
      "Laminated pine is structurally engineered timber, made from premium radiata pine that has been finger-joined and laminated to produce a solid, straight, premium-looking product. Laminated pine is supplied pre-primed to prevent moisture ingress but will still require undercoating and top coating.",
      "With its golden hue and rural look, Macrocarpa is a Kiwi favourite – especially if you are looking to evoke a more rural feeling. Rough sawn or smooth, Macrocarpa brings solid character and warmth. Unless sealed, Macrocarpa will gradually silver in the sun. Note that Macrocarpa is not durable in-ground, so it is recommended that steel in-ground stirrups or brackets are used to secure your pergola.",
      "Recycled hardwoods bring a timeless story to your project. Their age, their dings, and dents all tell of years gone by. Recycled from railway sleepers or from old factory demolition sites, they add age and substance to your pergola and are always a talking point.",
      "Kwila is a Kiwi favourite and is found on decks and outdoor furniture throughout the country. This affordable hardwood is harvested from responsibly managed tropical forests. Reddish in colour, it greys over time and is available in posts and beams.",
      "If you’re looking for a modern addition to your outdoor living or thinking of adding a roof to your pergola, then a powder-coated aluminium pergola is a great option. Using the Span Bar system, these aluminium pergolas are both strong and elegant. Curved, single, and double-pitched pergolas can be designed, and when combined with our translucent roofing options, you can protect your outdoor area from the rain and the UV.",

The rusticated profile is often the profile of choice when showcasing the natural features of real timber, it also performs reliably in terms of water resistance and durability.",
      "The traditional shiplap profile of overlapping timbers has a long history in NZ and remains popular because of its distinctive styling in both vertical and horizontal finishes. The shiplap profile continues to offer great value for money with superior timbers providing outstanding stability and a look that suits both traditional and contemporary designs. The shiplap profile allows boards to contract and expand without warping making them the ideal choice for more extreme climates or coastal locations.",
      "The board and batten profile is a traditional timber cladding system composed of alternate wide vertical boards and narrow wooden strips (battens). It offers a dynamic and versatile solution that has seen a resurgence in popularity recently. Creating a distinctly contemporary look with negative detailing and shadow lines it is well suited to a variety of modern building designs. Affordable, flexible and available in a range of woodgrain and smooth finishes this profile adds great visual appeal and can also be used as a partial siding with textured walls or other types of facade.",
      "The splay cut or angled-cut weatherboard profile is made up of boards that are cut at an angle to provide a chamfered edge on each side, producing a parallelogram shape.

      "Ventilation helps the circulation of fresh air through your home. It allows moisture and airborne pollutants to escape, and fresh clean air to be drawn into your home resulting in better air quality. The importance of ventilation in our homes is often overlooked but the benefits are clear and significant in keeping your family healthy. These benefits include preventing mould & mildew, protecting against dust mites, and reducing vapour and moisture which in turn reduce the risk of virus infection, asthma, and other respiratory problems. Ventilation solutions like Heat Transfer options can be a good add on to your chosen heating solution. They are a great way to utilize excess warm air from living rooms that feature solid fuel burners, to provide some heat to the bedrooms via a ducted system in the ceiling.",

The western red heartwood displays stunning variations in colour - from dark brown and pink when fresh, turning to silver-grey when weathered. It's straight grained with a coarse texture and has a very low shrinkage factor. Because it machines and holds a stain well, it is the cladding of choice for many architecturally designed homes.

      "Form plywood is specifically manufactured for use in making concrete forms. Strong and stiff, form plywood is overlaid with heavy-duty, phenolic resin paper on one or both sides to create a non-stick surface. This prevents the concrete from adhering to the form and enables easy removal and re-use of the form plywood. The water-repellant overlay paper also prevents moisture from the concrete from damaging the plywood veneers and creates a smooth finish to the concrete. This saves construction time and labour on finishing grinding. When used for concrete subfloors, form plywood must have an F stress grade rating.",

As non-bracing cladding, they are manufactured to achieve a minimum of 15 years’ durability*. Plywood cladding cannot be used for all buildings, and you should check the manufacturer’s specifications.

As a structural ply, it is certified to AS/NZS 2269 and available in F8 stress grades and higher. When laying roofing ply, the sheet should always be laid perpendicular to the roof truss to achieve the maximum structural strength, and the sheets should be staggered. Roof ply comes in an unsanded DD surface grade which gives roofers extra grip when installing. As a roofing substrate normally used under shingles or bitumen, care needs to be taken to seal any cut edges with a preservative treatment.",
      "As the name suggests marine plywood is primarily used for boat building, where its superior qualities of strength, consistency and impact resistance have made it the “go to” material for decades. But marine ply also suits a wide number of applications where moisture can be an issue. Kitchens, laundry areas - even saunas and swimming pool changing rooms are ideal locations for marine ply. The main difference with marine ply is the waterproof resin (glue) between each of the thin layers of wood. As well as the resin, marine ply must be constructed to British Standard. But even with these elements, marine ply still needs layers of treatment to maximise its lifespan. The rule of thumb is a layer of epoxy sealant per layer of wood in the ply. Due to its special nature marine plywood is available from PlaceMakers on special order.",
      "Interior plywood lining is easy to use, comes in a range of profiles, wood types and colours that help homeowners and designers create amazing finishes. Whether you're after a clean, natural look or a traditional 'V' groove effect - plywood is an economical answer. Improved bracing characteristics mean some new interior plywood panels can now be attached directly to the house framing - instead of over gib board. This can save homeowners plenty of money on their project. From garages to tiny homes, or to sleek Scandinavian look high-end residences, plywood linings are proving more popular than ever.",
      "Plywood is one of the most popular flooring sheet products as it has excellent strength and bracing properties and is easy to install and maintain. Ply flooring is ideal for residential, commercial, and industrial projects. The most common thickness for ply flooring is 19mm and the most common treatment is H3.2. Treated ply flooring should be used for the “wet” areas such as bathrooms and laundries, however, some builders prefer to take the extra precaution of using H3.2 treated plywood for the entire building. Flooring ply is available with a tongue and groove (T&G) edge system for easy interlocking. Sheets must be laid perpendicular to the floor joists.",
      "Only structurally tested plywood has a strength rating using an 'F' rated system. Any plywood without a strength rating is considered “non-structural”. Architects, engineers and builders need to know the strengths of the components when designing and constructing a building. Depending on the application of the plywood, this will determine what the minimum rating and thickness needs to be. Structural plywood needs to be treated for exterior or wet area use.",
      "Non-Structural Plywood is a great solution for projects which don’t need to provide structural performance or load-bearing qualities. It’s a great option for temporary hoardings, small projects such as building a dolls house and non-structural packaging. Non-Structural Plywood is available in both treated and untreated sheets and in a range of thicknesses. Generally, it is a lower grade of plywood and may have open face knots and surface inconsistencies which reflect the practical nature of the product.",
      "This hardwood veneer is pressed onto a poplar core giving it an appealing aesthetic while keeping the cost of the product to an affordable level. No sanding or stopping required when using for an interior lining solution, with its pre-sanded faces you can paint or stain it.",

      "While building specifications are hard and time-consuming to change mid-build, new plywood products with approved bracing units and appearance grade facing are now available in New Zealand, and at Placemakers.",
      "We’re not just the shaky isles, we’re the windy isles. House frames move in high wind zones, so wall linings need to have a certain amount of extra bracing. The Building Code NZ3604:2011 specifies the minimum bracing capacity for wind and earthquakes. The bracing demand to resist wind is expressed in Bracing Units or B/Us per lineal metre or per square metre for earthquakes. Architects and engineers refer to tables to calculate the correct bracing application for each build, bearing mind its structure, location, and orientation.",
      "Plasterboard changed the game by getting consent for its inherent bracing properties included in the bracing calculations. This meant fewer additional fixings and fastenings were required in the build, saving construction time and money. But it only applied to plasterboard. Even if plywood was used, you still needed to add plasterboard behind the ply to meet building standards.",
      "Now there’s an improved range of bracing ply that meets the bracing units required to pass consent. You no longer need to include plasterboard behind the ply, so you can save time, 10mm of internal wall space and money on every wall. The new ply products also have higher quality faces which offer a range of finishing opportunities. A natural wood look, a smooth finish for painting or staining.",

Any copper that is released into the environment bonds with the soil and becomes biologically inactive.",
      "Another benefit of MCA pressure treated wood is that it is approved for aluminium contact.

      "Structural plywood offers a reliable solution for applications requiring long-term load-bearing and structural performance. But distinguishing structural plywood from other types can be essential. In this article, we'll explore what defines structural plywood and how to identify it on-site.",
      "Structural plywood is designed to meet engineering standards and must possess consistent properties to ensure it can safely and reliably bear structural loads over its intended lifespan. Specifications for structural plywood are outlined in AS/NZS 2269.0:2008 Plywood – Structural – Specifications. The structural properties are assessed through machine stress-grading, with 100% of production rigorously examined, or in-grade analysis for products manufactured to precise specifications. Laboratory tests determine crucial properties like modulus of elasticity (MoE), bending strength, shear strength, tension strength, and compression strength, with in-mill verification ensuring ongoing stiffness and strength monitoring. To meet structural requirements, the adhesive used must be durable and creep-resistant, with Type A bond phenolic adhesives proving suitable for long-lasting applications in full exposure.",
      "To identify structural plywood, examine the rear of the sheet for the AS/NZS 2269 standard number, indicating compliance with structural standards. AS/NZS 2269 requires the following markings on the rear of all structural plywood sheets:",
      "Structural plywood finds use in various applications, including flooring, structural bracing, and roofing substrates. Its appeal lies in its consistent performance, ease of workability, and sustainability.",
      "For dry protected applications, structural plywood can meet the New Zealand Building Code's requirement of not less than 50-year durability without treatment. However, when exposed to moisture, such as in exterior cladding, it must be treated to at least timber treatment hazard class H3 to meet Building Code durability standards.",
      "It's crucial to differentiate between plywood and structural plywood. Non-structural plywood should not be substituted for structural plywood, as doing so may lead to structural failure and eventual collapse.",
      "Designers must specify both the plywood hazard class and the preservative treatment to ensure the correct material is used. Hazard classes, listed in NZS 3602:2003, should be selected with care. Some plywood applications require specific preservative treatments, like waterborne preservatives for membrane-roofing substrates, and specifying the correct treatment is vital to prevent compatibility issues and ensure structural integrity.",
      "In summary, structural plywood is a reliable choice for projects demanding long-term structural performance. Understanding its characteristics and how to identify it can help ensure the safety and integrity of your construction projects.",
      "Form plywood is specifically manufactured for use in making concrete forms.",
      "Interior plywood lining is easy to use, comes in a range of profiles, wood types and colours that help homeowners and designers create amazing finishes.",

      "Composed of fine glass fibres, fibreglass, or glasswool insulation as it is sometimes known, is a popular choice in residential, commercial, and industrial applications. It works by trapping pockets of air between the fibres, creating a barrier that reduces heat transfer. One of the key advantages of fibreglass insulation is its versatility. It can be installed in walls, ceilings, and underfloor to enhance energy efficiency and maintain a comfortable indoor environment. Additionally, fibreglass insulation is fire-resistant and does not absorb moisture, preventing mould and mildew growth. Its durability and cost-effectiveness further contribute to its widespread use, making it a reliable and efficient solution for enhancing thermal performance in buildings. At PlaceMakers we offer Pink Batts insulation and Eliment inulsation in our Fibreglass range.",

      "We’re not just the shaky isles, we’re the windy isles. House frames move in high wind zones, so wall linings need to have a certain amount of extra bracing. The Building Code NZ3604:2011 specifies the minimum bracing capacity for wind and earthquakes. The bracing demand to resist wind is expressed in Bracing Units or B/Us per lineal metre or per square metre for earthquakes. Architects and engineers refer to tables to calculate the correct bracing application for each build, bearing mind its structure, location, and orientation.",
      "Gib board changed the game by getting consent for the inherent bracing properties of Gib included in the bracing calculations. This meant fewer additional fixings and fastenings were required in the build, saving construction time and money. But it only applied to Gib. Even if plywood was used, you still needed to gib behind the ply to meet building standards.",
      "Now there’s an improved range of bracing ply that meets the bracing units required to pass consent. You no longer need to gib behind the ply, so you can save time, 10mm of internal wall space and money on every wall.

      "Screws are an indispensable fastenings choice across numerous industries and applications. Their threaded design is a hallmark of their functionality, facilitating a secure grip that surpasses many other fastening methods. This unique feature allows screws to firmly hold materials together, whether wood, metal, drywall, or even concrete.",
      "Check out our guide below to find the right screw for your job:",
      "Each screw in our comprehensive collection undergoes rigorous testing and evaluation to ensure it meets the demanding requirements of various trades. Whether you're working on decking, landscaping, general construction, metal fabrication, or specialised projects, our extensive range of screws has you covered.\n\nFrom corrosion-resistant exterior screws for outdoor projects to high-strength structural screws for heavy-duty applications, we provide a diverse array of options to suit your specific needs.",
      "Choosing the right screws for your deck is crucial for ensuring its longevity, structural integrity, and overall aesthetic appeal. Several factors need to be considered when selecting screws for deck construction, including the type of decking material, environmental conditions, and desired appearance.",
      "Choosing the right screws for a landscaping project is crucial to ensure the longevity and stability of your outdoor structures. When considering above-ground applications such as constructing decks, pergolas, or fences, opt for corrosion-resistant screws made from stainless steel or coated with materials.",
      "General construction screws are available in interior and exterior options. For interior applications, screws are zinc plated while exterior applications can use stainless steel or galvanised screws.",
      "If you're fastening into metal then make sure you avoid using regular wood screws and choose a screw specifically designed for metal instead. The point at the tip of a metal screw is designed to drill through steel and most other metals without pre-driling the material first.",
      "From installing hinges to attaching brackets into concrete, there are a number of different projects which require unique types of screws with distinct features and capabilities to help get the job done.",
      "For Kwila decking, Garapa decking, Vitex decking or hardwood timber applications where a more decorative finish is required. The screw's 316 stainless steel material with a Bronze finish provides premium corrosion resistance with a high end decorative finish and can be used in outdoor or sea spray zone applications. The screws have T-REX Teeth, T20 TX TORX drive driver bit included in each packet and a Reverse Tip for quick and easy installation.",
