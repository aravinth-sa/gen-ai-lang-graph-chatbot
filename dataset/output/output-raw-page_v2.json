      "IntroductionProper installation, care and maintenance will ensure you get the best performance from your deck. These recommendations should be read in conjunction with NZS3602, NZS3604, NZS3605, NZS3640, NZS4203 and BRANZ Bulletin 489 and any relevant Territorial Authority requirements.",
      "Storage and HandlingGarapa decking should be kept dry and out of the weather until installation. On site each pack should be kept off the ground by at least 100mm by placing it on bearers and covered to protect from sun and rain.",
      "VentilationFree air circulation under the decking is very important to help minimise cupping and warping for any timber. Proper ventilation ensures the potential difference in moisture levels between top face and the underside of the boards is reduced and extends the life and performance of the deck. The sub deck should have at least 450mm clearance from the ground and should also have adequate drainage. This, in conjunction with suitable spacing, will allow for adequate ventilation. NB: It is important that the perimeter of the deck is not fully enclosed by a surround, and remains open to airflow. Completely enclosing the sides of the deck will inhibit proper ventilation and compromise the performance of the decking. In wet areas or over water, additional clearance is recommended. Failure to provide for suitable ventilation is a major cause of early decking failure. Other steps that can be taken to minimise moisture differential are:",
      "A.A ground level vapour barrier (with slit drainage).",
      "B.A suitable surface coating on all four sides of the decking boards (refer coating section).",
      "SpanGarapa Decking 19mm thick should be installed at maximum 450mm joist centres. For 32mm thick decking this can be increased up to 600mm joist centres. Given that Radiata pine joists are softwood and Garapa is a strong hardwood, the joists should be clean and sound and the screws should penetrate at least 40mm into the joists to achieve good holding. Pre-drilling and countersinking is essential to avoid end splits. End Sealing End sealing will help minimise splitting and checking at the ends of the boards. We recommend the boards be end-sealed with a quality penetrating oil as soon as possible after cutting and before final installation.",
      "CoatingIn order to minimise surface checking, cupping and discolouration it is recommended Garapa decking be coated on all four sides prior to being laid. This will slow moisture transference into and out of the wood, thus maintaining more even moisture content through the piece. Proper coatings can vastly decrease the maintenance required on your decking. NB: Boards should be free of all surface marks and stains before coating. It is recommended that a “clear” decking oil is used.",
      "SpacingIn average New Zealand climatic conditions, Kiln Dried (KD) decking will expand slightly. KD (i.e. under 18% moisture content) decking will need extra spacing or gaps, to allow for expansion as the decking takes in ambient moisture. If laid too closely the deck will swell and possibly lift off the joists. In average New Zealand climatic conditions 90x19mm KD decking should be spaced 4mm apart. 140x19mm decking should be spaced 6mm apart. The specified gap for each size will allow the deck to drain and allow air circulation under and around the decking. NB: These are recommendations only. An allowance for regional climate conditions should also be factored in.",
      "FasteningScrews are essential for 140x19mm decking. We recommend 10g 65mm stainless steel (T316) screws through the pre-drilled and countersunk face of each board, two per joist 20 mm from the ends and edges. Care should be taken not to over-drive screws. For 90x19mm decking screws are also recommended (see PlaceMakers Fastening Catalogue for full range). However, if you chose nails they should be of sufficient length (60mm), stainless steel (T316) with annular grooves.",
      "Cleaning & WashingHardwood decks should be cleaned with a stiff brush at least once a year to clear gaps and remove surface mould which can be a slip hazard in wet weather. It is also important for the life of the deck to keep it clear of leaf litter, place pot plants or other large objects on raised “feet” to allow the decking under them to dry out. Hardwood decking can be water blasted BUT it is important to do so at a low pressure so as not to damage the fibres of the board by going too hard and/or too close. Care must be taken not to stop at the end of the stroke but to lift the nozzle away when changing direction. Washing/brushing the deck down with a mild solution of Janola and water (1:16), or suitable equivalent, will remove any build-up of resin or extractives that may leach out of the timber as the pieces “season” in situ. There are also various chemical cleaning agents available, from detergents through to acids. Follow manufacturer’s instructions and be conscious of the run off.

      "C. Apply a deck cleaning solution. It is recommended that the cleaning solution is biodegradable and not harmful to plants. It is also beneficial if the cleaner has a mouldercide in it to kill and stop the regrowth of any moulds.

A water blaster can be used but the pressure should be no higher than 600 PSI, the nozzle should not be held in one place for too long or too close to the deck.",

Hardwood decking can be water-blasted BUT it is important to do so at a low pressure so as not to damage the fibres of the board by going too hard and/or too close. Care must be taken not to stop at the end of the stroke but to lift the nozzle away when changing direction. Washing/brushing the deck down with a mild solution of Janola and water (1:16), or suitable equivalent, will remove any build-up of resin or extractives that may leach out of the timber as the pieces “season” in situ.

      "A classic Kiwi decking timber, our locally sourced pine is a budget-friendly option that requires an annual clean plus sanding and staining every 1-2 years. You can expect your pine deck to last around 15 years with regular maintenance. Available in two grades, ‘merch pine’ and ‘premium pine’, this timber is a light tan colour that will weather off to silver or is easily stained. Pine timber features knots - naturally occurring imperfections in the wood grain – and is prone to contracting and expanding with changing temperatures.",
      "Modified Pine such as Abodo Vulcan, and Accoya are alternatives to traditional pine that have been treated to make this timber as durable as hardwoods. More resistant to cracking and warping, these products are easily maintained with an annual clean and do not require re-painting or staining. Abodo Vulcan is avaialble in a dark brown, and Accoya is grey. Read on for further information on each option.",
      "Hardwood timbers such as kwila, kwila ShadowDeck, garapa, vitex, and purpleheart are sourced from responsibly managed tropical forests worldwide. Dense, durable, and water-resistant, these timbers are low maintenance, only requiring cleaning every 1-2 years. Whilst kwila and kwila ShadowDeck are red-brown and will ‘bleed’ colour, garapa, vitex, and purpleheart do not leach, so they may be more suitable depending on your outdoor living design. For more on each timber, read on.",
      "The technology of composite decking has advanced significantly over the last decade. An alternative to timber, these products are typically made of recycled wood fibre and recycled plastic or polyethylene. Highly durable and almost maintenance-free, composite provides a timber look and feel with various finishes available. While the initial investment can be more expensive than traditional timber, a composite deck will pay itself off within a few years due to its low maintenance.

      "Introducing a brand-new local series that's powered by the PlaceMakers Foundation: Clubhouse Rescue. Airing from Friday 3 February 2023 on Bravo, this heart-warming eight-part series is fronted by All Black legends Israel Dagg and Stephen Donald. Together with a team of designers and builders, they tackle major renovations of eight small grassroots clubs in desperate need of a makeover.",
      "The PlaceMakers Foundation was the exclusive building materials supplier for the series, with special thanks to the following PlaceMakers stores for their support: Whangarei, Silverdale, Pukekohe, Takanini, and Te Rapa.",
      "Watch the trailer now:",
      "Check out the official preview of what's to come in this heart-warming local series, Clubhouse Rescue. Join Israel Dagg, Stephen Donald, plus a team of designers and builders as they breathe life into eight small grassroots sports clubs. Premieres on Bravo at 7.30pm from Friday 3 February 2023.",
      "See the episode highlights along with before and after photos",
      "The series kicks off at the Hibiscus Coast Football Club on the stunning shores of Stanmore Bay. With over 1000 members, this club is a central hub for the coastal football community. However, the changing rooms are desperate for a makeover and don't even have doors, making them inadequate for the large and growing female membership.",
      "The team have their work cut out at the Te Rapa Squash Club in the mighty Waikato, but they are certainly up to the task. The renovation list is long and includes knocking out a wall to allow for better flow between the clubroom and courts, rebuilding the men's changing room to provide more privacy, and creating a grandstand so spectators can enjoy the action.",
      "Weymouth Rugby Club is blessed with a picturesque location, but struggling with major vandalism issues and flooding that causes the roof to cave in. The team focus on upgrading the changing rooms and kitchen whilst a local trust gets involved to make the building state of the art. With a couple of other surprises thrown in the mix, the members of this club are nothing but resilient.",
      "The team are introduced to the surprisingly underground sport that is inline hockey at the Hamilton Inline Hockey Club. Think ice hockey, without the ice, and add roller blades. The space is huge, incredibly loud, and the roof leaks. In addition, the team tackle the thread-bare carpet and upgrade the mezzanine. Tune in to find out if the team make the rink safe to roll on again!",
      "The team head to Northland to help Sherwood Park Golf Club give the club a much-needed update. Aware that their ageging membership is an issuse for the longevity of the club, the members all pitch in to modernise the clubrooms and make the most of their incredible views to entice new, younger players.",
      "The final episode sees the team head north to the Opuawhanga Tennis Club. This club brings together people from three communities in the warmer months, as they arrive in droves to play tennis and share a meal from the BBQ. Unfortuanately, the club has no electricity, functioning toilet, and only one court is uncracked. The most emotional renovation of the season, this one is a must-watch!",
      "Heading to the Papatoetoe Softball Club, a major hub for those community members who have grown up with the sport. When problems arise, all members pitch in to help. This week the team focuses on renovating the outdoor al fresco area, extend the kitchen space, and make some bold colour choices inspired by the club colours.",
      "Puni Rugby Club in rural Auckland is the true heart of the local community. But without funds for repairs and just the sheer size of the clubrooms, everything from the roof, the flooring, and all-important kitchen need to be renovated. One of the biggest challenges of the series sees the team pull together for an emotional transformation."

A building complies with this method if its thermal envelope components – roof, (usually external) walls, windows, doors, skylights and floor – are insulated to meet or exceed R-values from the tables. The R-values vary depending on the climate zone a building is in.",

      "In practice, this means it allows trading off between elements so you can use higher R-values for some elements than in the table shown and lower R-values for others.",
      "However, there are limits. Using the calculation method, the minimum R-value for a floor, wall or roof building element is 50% of the schedule method R-value for that building element. There is no minimum for doors and windows.",

      "This method provides the greatest amount of flexibility. It is used to assess the energy performance of a proposed building by using a simulation of the building to predict its space heating loads and cooling loads. This is compared with the space heating loads and cooling loads of a reference building that is the same shape, dimensions, and orientation as the proposed building, as well as building elements with the relevant construction R-values.",
      "Verification of the design is achieved by using computer modelling to demonstrate that the energy use of the proposed building design does not exceed the energy use of the reference building described above and in more detail in Appendix D of H1/VM1.",

Thermal resistance - how well the building is insulated - is specified in these documents using R-values.",

Pavers can be laid in stages, and even better, they can be lifted if drains, cables or pipes underneath ever need servicing.",

      "Buy all your pavers from one place and from the same batch if possible, to avoid differences in colour that can result from different batches. If you can’t buy all in one batch, mix the pavers up before laying. Please note: pavers may also displa \na “whitening” otherwise known as efflorescence effect. This is a characteristic of many masonry products and does diminish over time. If you have any trouble working out the quantities of each paver you need, PlaceMakers offers a free estimation service.",
      "Like any building job, you’ve got to get the foundations right. Extensive areas of paving, particularly where large areas of soft topsoil have to be dug out, require large volumes of materials. There are four main materials:",
      "On smaller sites, piles of materials can crowd the area you want to pave. If that’s the case, take delivery of the later stage materials only as you are ready to use them. That means digging out and laying the base course material first, then get the bedding sand and pavers delivered.",
      "Weight of trafficSome pavers can only withstand pedestrian use. Others will take light vehicle\ntraffic. Even stronger pavers will handle heavy vehicles. Check the specifications with PlaceMakers.",
      "Paver shape and sizeYour choice should suit the size and shape of the area being paved. Laying pattern: Again, this should suit the area being paved. Laying options include: 45 degree herringbone, stretcherbond, basketweave, soldier courses along the edges",
      "Check the manufacturer’s recommendations.",
      "A.Determine the finished level of the highest part of your paving. Against buildings, that should be at least 150mm below the level of concrete floors, \nor below the ground level under timber floors. From there, your paving should slope between 15mm to 30mm per metre away from the building.\nThis prevents puddling or running under buildings.",
      "B.Dig out the area to be paved to the combined depth of the three layers, i.e.\npavers depth plus bedding sand and base course depths.",
      "Even after excavating, the sub-grade might have holes that need filling to bring it up to the desired level. Fill these with base material, and compact in layers no more than 100mm thick using a plate compactor or a rammer for small areas. Thorough compaction is vital especially at edges. The finished sub-grade level should be within 20mm of the contour of the finished paving.",
      "This should also be laid in layers no thicker than 100mm and compacted to a uniform dense condition, especially around manholes and kerbs. The finished texture of the base course should not allow bedding sand to filter through. The final surface of the base course should match the contour of your finished paving with no bumps, and no holes deeper than 10mm.",
      "Edging is important to prevent sideways movement of pavers, and to stop bedding sand leaking out.",
      "Edging options",
      "Bedding sand supports your pavers, but will not hide irregularities in the base course. It should be coarse river sand (not beach sand), and damp but not wet.",
      "If you have already laid a Soldier or Kerb course, you may be able to use that to support your runners. If the area to be paved is too wide you’ll need to drive pegs, and fix your runners to them, just like concrete boxing (see below).",
      "Your pavers now need to be consistently compacted over the whole area. Include a minimum of three passes with compactor each at 90 degrees to each other.",
      "In most cases maintenance will be minimal. If some pavers settle unevenly, or if underground services need to be exposed, your paving may require re-laying. To do this simply follow the procedures given above. It would pay to add a layer of weed matting below the sand layer to stop any weeds that could grow up and between your pavers. Where paving is cleaned or has water running across it the joint sand may require topping up periodically. To enhance the appearance of your paving special sealers are available. These may require reapplication over time. Ask at your PlaceMakers Firth Centre.",
      "NOTE: Building or landscaping work may have to comply with the New Zealand Building Code and your local Council requirements. Talk to the building inspectors at your council. They can provide helpful details of such matters and say whether or not a permit is required for the work you wish to do.",
      "Take note of potential problems such as drains, trees and electrical wiring.",
      "Check the height of the surface to be paved, take measurements and draw plans. Set the paving below the fl oor level and slightly sloped away from the house, or areas that you would want to keep water away from.",
      "Choose your pavers and design, measure up and order.",
      "If the ground is firm and well compacted excavate to a depth of 75mm, then move to next step. If soft or a fi lled site, excavate 75-100mm deeper and add 75-100mm of top course and compact well with a plate compactor.",
      "Now set up string-lines to give you lines to follow for both height and gapping.",
      "NB:It is critical to allow a minimum gap of 8mm between pavers, although a 10mm to 15mm gap is recommended.",

      "Retaining walls perform heavy and important work. Therefore high or complicated walls, perhaps supporting several metres of bank above a road or driveway, must be designed and constructed by experienced contractors. Retaining walls can also be used to terrace a slopping section, provide a levelled garden, flat lawn or paving. The retaining wall described here is less than 1.5M in height with post spacing set at 1.2M, and does not support any surcharge or load additional to that of the ground.",
      "1. Building Consents2. Retaining Wall Fundamentals3. Tools you'll need",
      "6. Timber Selection Guide",
      "While the whole wall has to be strong enough to support the load pressing against it, it’s the part below the ground that anchors it. No matter how sturdy the upper part of a wall is, if the footings or foundations are weak, there is nothing stopping it from falling over. Check with your council to determine if a geotechnical and structural engineering report is required.",
      "When soil or clay on a slope is waterlogged, it is practically unstoppable. Like jelly while it’s still liquid, you need a bowl to contain it, but after it’s set, it supports itself.",
      "So one of the main tasks required of a retaining wall is to drain water out of the bank behind. If a wall doesn’t drain well, even previously dry earth in the bank will gradually become waterlogged until it finally pushes the wall over. Check regulations regarding water run off from drainage.",
      "Draw a plan and take measurements to calculate materials required for this project.",
      "You need at least a 250mm gap between the back of the wall and the face of the bank. Decide where you want the wall and cut back the face of the bank if necessary.",
      "Make sure that the ground behind the wall line is level, or slopes toward the end where you want it to drain.",
      "Dig 500mm diameter holes every 1.2M along the line of the wall. The depth of the holes should be equivalent to 70% of the height of the wall. Examples: wall height 1M – hole depth 700mm, wall height 1.5M – hole depth 1.05M. If you have an engineer’s design, the hole depth will be specified.",
      "Put 100mm of concrete into the two end holes. Set posts on top of the concrete. Make sure only uncut post ends go into the holes. If that isn’t possible, paint cut ends with liberal amounts of timber preservative. Check that the top of the posts sit high enough.",
      "Lean posts slightly back into the hill (for a dead vertical wall, set the posts even deeper into the ground).",
      "Brace posts. Check that you have exactly the same lean back on both posts and they are plumb (vertical) when viewed from the front (see below).",
      "Fill the holes with concrete to within 100mm of ground level. Then tamp the concrete down with a piece of 100 x 50 timber, brace and leave to set.",
      "Run string lines top and bottom between the two set end posts. Use these as guides to line up intermediate posts. Set them in their holes the same way as the end posts.",
      "When all posts are in place, leave a couple of days for the concrete to set properly. The use of Dricon Rapid Set can speed this process up.",
      "Nail horizontal rails (logs) to the back of the posts, starting at the bottom and working to the top of the wall. Join rails only on the posts. The gaps that occur between them will allow water to percolate through.",
      "When the wall is complete, lay about 50mm of clean drainage metal along the bottom at the back of the wall. Cover drain coil (punctured) with a filter sock then lay on top of the metal and cover with about 250mm more drainage metal. If possible, protrude the drain coil at both ends so you can flush it with a garden hose from time to time.",
      "Position old sheets of hardboard, cardboard, or plasterboard down the back, about 250mm behind the wall. Keeping the level the same on both sides of the sheets, fill between them and the wall with more drainage metal; and behind with any dug out soil or clay. Take the metal to within 300mm of the ground surface at the top of the wall, place geotextile fabric over free draining gravel, and then fill with topsoil. The drainage metal is needed as far as possible up the back of the wall for optimum drainage. The sheets contain it, so you don’t use any more than necessary. They will eventually disintegrate (see below).",
      "If your wall is to support new fill, leave at least two more weeks for the concrete to set completely before vigorously compacting the backfill.",

      "The main purpose of retaining walls is to hold back soil and prevent erosion. You can also use retaining walls to create level surfaces or terraces, provide structural stability and improve the overall aesthetics of your property. The main materials for retaining walls include timber, sleepers, retaining blocks, masonry, and galvanised wire (gabion) baskets filled with stones.",
      "Before you start, it's important to know that in New Zealand any retaining walls over 1.5 metres high require building consent from your local council. Some walls lower than 1.5 metres that carry extra loading such, as  driveway, building, or steep slope also require building consent.

Gabions can be linked together to form structures that drain well and help to stabilise your soil. They look great as retaining walls or can be used to create feature objects in your garden.",
      "Retaining walls in New Zealand must comply with local building codes and regulations, which specify requirements for design, construction, and safety. This will include factors such as the height of the wall, soil conditions, drainage, and earthquake considerations. It’s important to consult with a qualified engineer or landscape professional before you start to ensure all retaining walls are safe, structurally sound, and comply with local regulations.",
      "While the whole wall must be strong, it’s the part below ground that anchors it. If your footings or foundations are weak, there is nothing to stop a retaining wall from falling over.",
      "You need to understand the soil properties behind and below your retaining wall. Soil type, moisture content and bearing capacity should determine the design and materials required for your retaining wall.",
      "Proper drainage is important to prevent water build-up which can cause structural failure. Drainage systems such as weep holes, gravel backfill, and geotextile fabrics may need to be incorporated into your design.",
      "Slopes that are prone to erosion, landslides, or other natural forces may require additional stabilization measures such as geogrids or soil reinforcement.",

      "A retaining wall is a great way to improve the look of your lawn and garden. It can be a beautiful feature as well as the perfect way to create a flat lawn on a sloping section.",
      "However, because retaining walls have an important job to do, we advise you to call in an expert for any wall over 900mm high.",
      "Before you start any landscaping or building project, it’s important you make sure the finished job will comply with the building code and council regulations. For full information on the regulations applying to your area, consult with your local council.",
      "Do a scale drawing of the area that you want to retain. From that, estimate the quantities you need. Remember some extra materials will be required for cutting, depending on the size and shape of the area.",
      "1. Tools2. Materials",
      "Buy all your retaining wall blocks from one place and from the same batch if possible, to avoid differences in colour that can result from different batches. Blocks may also display a “whitening” effect otherwise known as efflorescence. This is a characteristic of many masonry products and does diminish over time.",
      "If you can’t buy all blocks from one batch, mix the units up before laying. If you have any trouble working out the quantities of the blocks you need, PlaceMakers offers a free estimation service.",
      "Like any building job, you’ve got to get the foundations right. A large retaining wall will require large volumes of materials.",
      "There are three main materials: retaining wall blocks, base course material & drainage aggregate.",
      "Firth retaining wall blocks feature a unique rear lip to eliminate guesswork, speed installation and deliver a uniform setback.",
      "Ezi Wall®is a two-piece system with a split face texture that gives great design flexibility.",
      "Sedona Stone®has straight & bevelled keycut face texture that gives great design flexibility.",
      "Garden Wall®has straight & bevelled, split face that enables construction of inside curves, outside curves & straight walls.",
      "Country Manor®has keycut face texture that enables construction of inside curves, outside curves & straight walls.",
      "Dig out the area behind where your wall will go to allow for backfill. Then dig a trench along the line of your wall’s planned base to the width and depth shown in the table (see Fig.1 below).",
      "Compact the soil in the base of your trench. Then add compactable base course (fine gravel) to the trench and compact until firm and level (for Firth Ezi Wall® / Sedona Stone® /Garden Wall®) to a depth of 150mm. For Country Manor a depth of 200mm is required. Check this both ways with a level and stringline to make sure your wall will be built on a good foundation (see Fig.2).",
      "Getting the first layer perfectly level is critical to the accuracy of your wall. For Sedona and Garden Wall, chisel the locator lips off the blocks for the first layer prior to laying. Place the first layer of blocks on the prepared base, making sure that each block is in full contact with the base course and level from side to side and front to back. Stringline the back of the first layer to verify straightness. On sloping sites always start from the lowest point and work upwards (see Fig.3).",
      "If the wall is going to be over 3 layers, place a drainage coil (65 or 100mm diameter) behind the first “above ground” layer of the wall. Extend the coil away from the wall to ensure good drainage. Connect the coil to the nearest silt trap.",
      "Make sure the top of each layer of blocks is perfectly level and free of aggregate and soil before laying the next layer of blocks. Lay subsequent layers of blocks by pulling each unit forward so that the rear lip engages with the blocks below. Each unit should be offset by half a unit below to maintain a “running bond” pattern.",
      "As each layer is finished, backfill with free drainage aggregate extending out 150mm for Eziwall/Sedona Stone and Garden Wall. 300mm for Country Manor and compact. Do not use topsoil or clay material as backfill. As you build your wall, fill the cavity behind it. Ensure all cavities within each unit and gaps between are filled with free drainage aggregate. Backfilling and compaction should be carried out in 150mm to 200mm layers (see Fig.4).",
      "Once your wall reaches the desired height, use the compactor to f irmly compact and fill behind the wall. Do not use the compactor on the wall itself. If using Ezi Wall®, affix the capping units to the top of the wall using a building adhesive. If using Country Manor® use the capping block and pins. If you plan to have a garden level with the top of your wall, backfill and compact to below the desired depth of your bed then add topsoil to the wall level (see Fig.5).",

      "Kiwis love outdoor living, and a pergola can extend your deck to enhance your home. A pergola frames your space, makes a statement, and can provide year-round protection - as well as lots of entertaining possibilities. Wooden pergolas can also be used in landscaping to form a shaded pathway or to support vines or roses. To protect your outdoor space in all weather, your pergola can be turned into a veranda with translucent roofing to allow the light in and the rain out. Flat or corrugated, these lightweight roofing systems bring years of outdoor enjoyment while protecting your family from New Zealand’s harmful UV rays.",
      "Whatever pergola design you’re going for; classic, rustic, recycled or industrial, PlaceMakers have a range of wooden and aluminium pergolas and translucent roofing to complete the project and bring resort-like comfort to your outdoor space.",
      "Looking to create your ultimate outdoor living area? We can help with that.",
      "Explore now:",
      "Pergolas can be made from solid treated timber posts and beams, or laminated pine timber for extra strength and straightness. Or, for that quintessential rural look, choose Macrocarpa with all its knots and character. Hardwoods, whether recycled railway sleepers or sustainably harvested Kwila, are another way to add rugged beauty to your project. Or, for an ultra-modern sleek look, choose an aluminium pergola, powder-coated to colour-match your home.",
      "Let the light in but keep the UV and the rain out. Our translucent roofing range extends from SunTuf corrugated polycarbonate roofing to fluted or flat Suntuf Twinwall, right through to the glass-like profiles of SunGlaze and ClearVue that give you that glass look without the cost. If you prefer your outdoor space to be more open, choose a louvre system with automatic rain-sensing technology.",

      "Painting the exterior of your house can take a number of weeks to complete. Because of this it is recommended that you prepare and paint only one side of the house at a time. Preparation is the key to any good paint job so no task should be overlooked when preparing your\nhouse for painting (refer to our Know How brochure Preparing to Paint).",
      "The paint work must be in good, sound condition, with no rusty areas, peeling or flaking paint. It must be free from contaminants such as mould, lichen, mildew and any other contaminant that will affect the adhesion of the new paint.",
      "Salt deposits from coastal environments, \n industrial fallout and aeroplane contaminants must all be treated to remove. To extend the life of your painted finish it is advisable to wash down the outside of your house on a regular basis – once a year. This removes ingrained\ncontaminants from the paint work that slowly wear away the surface coating, resulting in premature failure.",
      "1. Tools2. Preparation",
      "Water blasting the exterior timber is not advisable as it can damage softer timbers and force water into the fibres, resulting in the possibility of cracked and warped surfaces.",
      "Wash the exterior surfaces with sugar soap to remove the contaminants and flush with plenty of fresh water. It is advisable to wash small areas at a time to avoid the wash solution drying which then makes it difficult to remove.",
      "Mould can be a major issue with some houses, especially on the southern side of the house. This should be treated with the appropriate mould remover/killer prior to preparation.",
      "Loose, flaking and cracked paint should be completely removed to avoid adhesion problems later in the paint’s life. Check all areas of the paint work for peeling. A simple test to check for adhesion is to put an X cut in the paint work with a sharp knife. Put a piece of sticky tape over the cut, sticking down well, and pull the tape off. If any paint comes off then the area will have to be stripped back to a sound surface.",
      "A)Check to see if your old paint is in good condition by making several cuts with a sharp knife or razor blade.",
      "B)Press a piece of strong adhesive tape across the area and peel it off.",
      "C)If the paint comes off with the tape, the surface should be stripped, sanded or scraped back to bare wood if possible.",
      "Sand the surface well, this helps the new paint to adhere.",
      "Any nails that have been exposed should be punched below the surface and it is advisable to prime with an anti-corrosive metal primer to avoid rust staining. This is also advisable if you have sanded any metal soakers (timber jointers) or any other steel surfaces prone to rust. If rust is evident, wire brush to remove as much rust as possible and treat with a metal prep prior to priming with your anticorrosive metal primer. All holes should be filled with appropriate exterior filler, then sanded when dry and primed/undercoated.",
      "If there is any possibility of the tannin timber treatment bleeding through light coloured acrylic finishes, it is advisable to prime using an oil-based wood primer.",
      "Fibre-cement or concrete finishes should be washed with an appropriate cleaner prior to repainting with your 100% acrylic finish. A minimum of 2 coats is required.",
      "Window frames that have had the putty dry and fall out should be reputtied. Remove all the old putty and clean the surface well so it’s free from contaminants. Prime the surface with oil-based wood primer and allow to dry. Once this has dried you can apply new putty, which should be left for approximately 3 weeks prior to painting. The reason for priming prior to applying the putty is that the oil in the putty will absorb into the woodwork, and the putty will dry out and fall out again.",
      "Most roofs will have some corrosion to deal with. Avoid water blasting, and make sure the surface is sound with no rust present. Wash the roof down with sugar soap, covering a small area at a time, and then flush off with fresh water until all areas are clean and free from contaminants. If there is rust, sand the affected areas and treat with the appropriate kill rust primer. Prime any bare areas with Galvanised Iron Primer and once dry, apply two finish coats of roof paint (minimum 2 hours between coats at 20°C and 65% humidity).",
      "With the amount of work involved in preparing the exterior for painting, it is recommended that you purchase the best possible product for the job to avoid disappointment later when the ‘cheaper’ paint starts to fail. Refer to our Know How brochures Selecting the Right Roller, Selecting the Right Brush and Choosing the Right Paint to help you get the best result.",
      "Once you have chosen your final colour, purchase all the paint at the same time and box (mix) all the containers of the same colour together to eliminate the colour variation that can occur within paints.",
      "The final topcoat that provides the perfect colour and finish is only part of a system of paints and preparations working as a team. Some paints are a simple system comprising two or three coats of the same paint. Paint intended for bare woodwork or metalwork often needs a more complex system, using paints with different qualities.",
      "Check with your local PlaceMakers and/or consult paint manufacturer’s brochures to select the right system for your needs.",
      "The paint can label holds vital information about how to apply the paint, as well as which undercoats and primers are compatible. Read it carefully and follow the instructions exactly. If you want clarification, ask PlaceMakers.",
      "Before starting, check the weather. Avoid painting in both very hot (more than 27˚C) or very cold (less than 10˚C) conditions. Fog or dusty conditions should also be avoided. Plan to finish painting at least two hours before sundown. Dew fall, as well as rain, can damage the paint.",
      "As a general rule, the parts of the house should be painted in this order:",
      "1. Roof.Apply the necessary primers or undercoats as directed by the instructions on the can for the finishing coat. Paint all the ridge, hip and valley flashings by brush and then fill the large areas with a roller for corrugated steel. Check the paint around nail and screw heads and touch up by brush where necessary.",
      "2. Eaves and verandah ceilings soffits.Paint all the barge and fascia boards and then the soffits. If your spouting is snapfastened PVC, removing the spouting can make painting the fascia much easier.",
      "3. Walls.Start at the highest point and paint the full length of the wall. Work down the wall, painting in wide vertical strips making sure you brush back into the wet edge of the previous strip. Then go back to the top and lightly run over the newly painted area with your brush to ensure even coverage and a smooth finish. For weatherboards, start at the top of the wall. Paint one or two boards at a time. Paint the under edge first, then the face of the boards working across then down.",
      "4. Windows.Either cut in around the glass with a cutting in brush, or mask the glass.",
      "5. Doors.Paint the edges first then apply paint to the face of the door, starting at the top. If the door has a moulding, paint the moulding first then do the remainder of the panels. If the door has a threshold, do that last.",
      "Dip no more than the first third of the brush into the paint, wiping off the excess on either side of the paint container, (not the rim) to prevent drips.",
      "When using acrylic paint, brushes and rollers should be washed out regularly to maintain paint flow.",
      "Apply a strip of masking tape around the perimeter of the glass, 2 or 3mm from the frame, allowing a narrow strip of painted glass to provide a weather seal.",
      "Remove the masking tape as the paint starts to dry and it will come away without tearing the paint film.",

      "Tiling demands patience and precision. This pamphlet takes you through the process for tiling ordinary interior walls and floors. Complicated room or wall shapes require extensive cutting and unusual tile shapes are difficult for the inexperienced handyperson. If you haven't tiled before, start with a simple, undemanding project.",
      "Shower tiling requires waterproofing of the substrate. This is beyond the skill of the average homeowner and the consequences of a leak can be expensive. Leave shower tiling to experienced, professional tilers.",
      "1. Materials required2. Floor versus wall tiles3. Checklist4. Floor tiling - before you begin",
      "5. Setting out procedure6. Installation (Floor)7. Wall tiling - before you begin8. Installation (Wall)",
      "Depending on the situation, you may also need:",
      "There are a large variety of ceramic tiles available. Floor tiles are obviously subject to considerably more weight and wear than wall tiles. Therefore, while floor tiles can sometimes be applied to walls, wall tiles must never be used on floors.",
      "Floor tiles are often thicker than wall tiles, or they may be vitrified (baked extremely dense and hard). This makes them more wear and damage resistant. Both wall and floor tiles may be glazed with a baked on gloss but, this coating is harder for floors.",
      "Do your homework when choosing tiles. Using inappropriate tiles can have disastrous consequences.",
      "Note: specialist tools can be hired.",
      "What can you tile over? The floor surface must be clean, dry, sound, flat and RIGID. Smooth concrete is ideal, as it's perfectly rigid. However, concrete floors should be at least four months old before tiling, so most of the shrinkage in the concrete has occurred.",
      "Timber and particleboard floors can be tiled over, but ALL flex must be taken out first. If you can feel the floor flexing when walked over, it's not suitable for tiling. More floor joists may need to be installed.",
      "A screwed and glued overlay of fibre cement board provides a smooth substrate for the tiles on top of timber floorboards.",
      "A damp-proof membrane is required when tiling over particle board in kitchens and bathrooms.",
      "(Squaring-off the area)You will need to establish horizontal and vertical lines to tile to. The length or width of a floor (or the height and width of a wall) is rarely an exact multiple of your tile width. So you will need cut tiles at one or both ends of both horizontal and vertical lines.",
      "It is usually better to have cuts along all edges, rather than a full tile at one end and a cut at the other. Then if the side walls are out of square, the change in cut tile width is less noticeable.",
      "The aim is to set full tiles in a squared rectangle in the centre of the floor, with cut tiles all around the edges. This is the same for a whole wall. (See above Illustration 1 ).",
      "Wall tiling presents the added difficulty of holding tiles on the wall while the adhesive sets. You may need to make up 50mm wide straight timber furring strips to use as tile guides and supports.",
      "If the wall has too much give or flex, you may need to strip off the lining, fix more studs and/or noggins, then reline with a suitable substrate.",
      "Wall tiles can be applied over plasterboard, fibre cement board, plywood, solid plaster, brick or blockwork. MDF board or chipboard are also fine, but not in wet or humid areas.",
      "Walls must be dry, flat, firm, clean, grease and soap free, with no loose paint, plaster or dust. Holes, dents and rough areas should be filled with a plaster based filler, then sanded smooth.",
      "Bare plasterboard, MDF or particleboard should be sealed with an oil based sealer. Tiling over joints in MDF or particleboard can cause problems unless a proper movement control joint is formed.",
      "Sound painted surfaces should be sanded and scratched to give the tiles grip.",
      "For tiling the whole wall:Setting out for walls is similar to floors, but you obviously can't lay tiles out dry on the wall. Mark a stick of timber in tile widths (see Illustration 4). Use that to calculate the position of full tiles. As with floors, adjust the position of the guide lines to ensure even and attractive lines of cut\ntiles along all edges.",
      "Use your spirit level to draw a plumb vertical line from the centre-point, to the top of the area to be tiled.",
      "For tiling part way up a wall: (e.g. to a dado) Ideally, the desired height will be achieved using only full tiles. You'll probably want to finish along the top with a full tile anyway.",
      "Use your spirit level to identify the lowest point of the wall. Floors and baths often run off a little. Set an upright tile against the wall at that spot. Using your spirit level, draw a perfectly horizontal line across the wall from the top of the tile. (See Illustration 5).",
      "This is where you can use your first furring strip. Nail a straight batten up to and beneath that line, to support the second line of tiles. They will be applied first.",
      "Find and mark the vertical centre line as with a full wall and start with a full tile from that line. Where there is an obvious outside corner or edge, like the front of a bath recess, start from the outside corner and work to the inner corner.",
      "All but one of the bottom row of tiles may need cutting. It depends on the setout.",

      "The Ara Education Charitable Trust (AECT) is a collaboration between industry, government agencies and schools to create work and training opportunities for school leavers from eight South Auckland schools - Aorere College, Manurewa High, Onehunga High and Southern Cross Campus.",
      "It was initially set up as Ara Jobs and Skills Hub by Auckland Airport in 2015 to connect South Auckland communities and job seekers with businesses looking to fill positions at and around the airport.",
      "When Covid-19 hit, some aspects of AECT's remit became unfeasible. So, the focus shifted to school engagement and wider industry applications.",
      "“AECT provides opportunities across all industries in New Zealand, however a key focus of ours is to support students in the transition from school into the construction industry through skills training, obtaining their driver's licences, certification and addressing any other skills gaps to ensure they are ready for the workforce,” said Trust General Manager Dr Sarah Redmond.",
      "One of the ways in which AECT supports students in the transition into construction is the Forever Home initiative – a project to turn a derelict house into a warm, sustainable and livable home. The house, donated by Auckland Airport, is worked on one day per week by students from the eight South Auckland schools under the watchful eye of carpentry tutors Willie Malakai and Mat Watford.",
      "The three-bedroom, one-bathroom farmhouse with “holes in the floor, walls and roof” is being transformed by AECT students into a modern, sustainable home with solar panels, thermal blinds and an HRV system.",
      "“These students are receiving practical, hands-on skills training while working on this house, which will help give them a solid foundation to enter the workforce once they finish school at the end of this year,” explained Dr Redmond in October 2023.",
      "The house is due to be completed by the end of November, after which it will be auctioned off, with all proceeds going back to the trust, so it can continue its work with students from some of Auckland’s most deprived areas.",
      "Personal development Malakai said it has been rewarding to watch the growth in confidence of the students working on the project.",
      "“It's been amazing to see their skills develop. At the start of the project, they didn’t know how to measure or use basic tools. It took three weeks to teach them the basics, and now they’re so confident – they can cut material without second-guessing themselves and it’s so satisfying to see.”",
      "Many of the students have now been signed on as apprentices.",
      "“I’d say the kids involved in this project are now way ahead of other first year apprentices in terms of skill level, and I’m confident they’re going to go and make something of their lives. I’m so happy for them.”",
      "PlaceMakers supported the Forever Home project by setting up a trade account and supplying several products for free, including an entire kitchen.",
      "Malakai said the Trust will continue to support young people beyond completion of the Forever Home project.",
      "“We have another programme called Ara Rangatahi Pathways to Employment, which is aimed at helping young people, aged 15-25, who have finished school and aren’t sure about their next steps. For this programme, we’ve had nine houses donated by Kāinga Ora, Piritahi, Auckland Airport and Auckland Council, which will all be renovated by our rangatahi and building tutors.",
      "“The kids come in on three-month rotations and then we help get them into the workforce. It’s been working well so far!”",
      "AECT also runs the Maori & Pasifika Women in Construction Project, which shows young Maori and Pasifika women what the construction industry can offer in terms of career pathways.",
      "“We equip them with everything they need to be successful in an industry that’s traditionally male-dominated,” explained Dr Redmond.",
      "Part of the work AECT does with Maori & Pasifika women involves running work experience programmes.",
      "“Students get the opportunity to work on some amazing work sites for one day a week throughout their final year of school.",
      "“Thanks to the ongoing support of Auckland International Airport Limited, Icon Construction and and Hawkins Construction, our students have had the chance to work on commercial construction sites ranging from the extension of Auckland Airport to large hotels, corporate offices and large residential developments.”",

      "PlaceMakers takes its environmental responsibility seriously, which is why it has invested in its first two electric delivery trucks – both of them FUSO eCanters fitted with tipper bodies. In Jason Fisk, the company has a driver who embraces the new technology and is only too pleased to talk about it",
      "By adding FUSO eCanters to its fleet, PlaceMakers has joined leaders from other industries, such as Fulton Hogan, Mainfreight and Genesis Energy, in taking a significant step towards reducing its Scope 1 emissions (CO2 emissions from owned or controlled sources).",
      "“Our aim is to reduce our carbon output by 30% by 2030,” says Fleet Optimisation Manager Shafeel Dean.",
      "“We have one truck in Wellington and one in Auckland and, if our experience with them goes well, we’ll look to make the rest of our tipper fleet electric over the next few years.”",
      "The 100% electric FUSO eCanter produces zero on-road emissions as it goes about its job, delivering construction supplies throughout the North Island’s two biggest cities.",
      "With a payload of up to 2.5T in its 4m-long tipper tray, its delivery capacity matches similar sized trucks, but its battery capacity means that considered route planning is required to maximise range and drop-offs.",
      "“It has a max range of around 100km, and I usually make six or seven drop-offs a day,” says Jason, who is the truck’s dedicated driver in Wellington.",
      "“I work with dispatch very closely. A lot depends on the load I’m carrying and whether the route is flat or hilly. I’ve learned to get the job furthest away done first then pick up smaller jobs closer to home.”",
      "Shafeel says that driver training is invaluable before climbing onboard an electric truck and adds that FUSO has been very supportive in this respect.",
      "“Our FUSO account manager spent time with some of our drivers and gave tips on handling and how to get the best out of the batteries,” he says. “I was impressed they took the effort to do that.”",
      "Shafeel adds that a lot of the drivers were surprised at the amount of torque eCanter produces.",
      "“It’s really good off the mark,” says Jason. “I’m away well before other trucks reach second gear – it’s brilliant!”",
      "Jason says the eCanter performs excellently around Wellington’s hilly streets and even up the Ngauranga Gorge section of SH1, which links Wellington City to its northern suburbs and beyond. With a grade of 8%, it’s no walk in the park, but Jason reports that the eCanter has more than enough pulling power from its 420v permanent synchronous electric motor, which produces up to 135kW and 390Nm.",
      "Of course, what goes up must come down, and that’s where the truck’s two-way regenerative braking system really comes into play, recovering energy that would otherwise be lost to the brake discs as heat and storing it in the battery instead.",
      "Jason describes working with the eCanter as “a brave new world” and acknowledges that adopting low or zero-emission modes of transport is the direction businesses need to be heading in. He’s proud to be part of it and after seven years with PlaceMakers is grateful for the opportunities he’s been given from his management team of Ash Johnson, Paul Bowden and Sean Wilson.",
      "With its bright blue branding, there are always a few interested looks onsite when Jason pulls up.",
      "“There have been some builders shocked (no pun intended) that it’s electric and I’m always happy to talk about the truck. People even come up to me when I’m charging it for a chat!”",
      "When it comes to recharging the 81kWh lithium-ion, liquid-cooled battery pack, Jason will plug in overnight at the truck’s home depot at Evans Bay and top up if needed at ChargeNet stations along his delivery route.",
      "Jason likes to top up whenever he gets to around half empty. Using a DC Fast Charger, that takes about 30 minutes.",
      "Out on the road, Jason says the cab is well provisioned and comes equipped with all the mod cons, such as Apple and Android CarPlay.",
      "“The cab is really comfortable; the seat is brilliant, and the leaf spring suspension means the ride is smooth – I don’t get any bounce from the road at all.”",
      "Jason’s experience is echoed by other drivers who have taken the eCanter on a delivery run, says Shafeel.",
      "“Drivers are saying they’re not as fatigued at the end of the day. The old mentality was that you needed to have a truck that bounced you around to keep you awake, but the feedback from the drivers is that they’re more alert and more comfortable in the cab.”",
      "He says there is added peace of mind thanks to a safety package that includes Active Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning and Electronic Stability Control.",
      "Reversing into those tight Wellington driveways on residential build sites is also easier with help from the truck’s reversing camera, and there is also an unrestricted view out the back of the cab.",
      "But for Jason and the PlaceMakers team, the eCanter is really all about looking forward – to a more sustainable future, and ensuring they are well-equipped to help their customers reduce the overall carbon footprint of their builds.",
      "Starting in Auckland, PlaceMakers will not wrap orders unless requested by customers, or if the product is in storage or rain is forecast.",

      "PlaceMakers mission to be more sustainable continues with a trial to reduce the amount of plastic wrap it uses as part of a broader waste reduction initiative. Starting in Auckland, PlaceMakers will not wrap orders unless requested by customers, or if the product is in storage or rain is forecast.",
      "If requested, PlaceMakers will charge a nominal $5 +GST fee to wrap the product, which will be donated to Forest and Bird – New Zealand’s leading independent conservation organisation.",
      "Ensuring that products arrive on site in top condition is still a priority for PlaceMakers and the reduction in wrapping won’t change that, says Nick Scott, PlaceMakers Head of Sustainability.",
      "“PlaceMakers staff are regularly checking forecasts to make sure that product always arrives in good condition, with weather updates sent out to our trial store locations.",
      "“When it’s forecast for rain, our staff will be primed to start wrapping!”",
      "Early reports indicate builders have been accepting of the move – in part because staff take great pride in ensuring product reaches site in great condition.",
      "“The change has been fairly seamless and we’ve received no negative feedback,” says Nick.",
      "“We estimate we’ve already reduced our plastic use by 60% in our Auckland stores; however, we expect this figure to improve over time.",
      "“Our target is to eliminate 37 rolls of plastic from entering our environment – but that may increase if the trial is extended to more stores!”",
      "The new initiative isn’t only focused on improving the environmental sustainability of PlaceMakers own business. A large part of Nick’s sustainability remit is to assist customers with their own efforts.\n “We’re looking to collaborate with key customers to see if we can assist with their sustainability initiatives, to help them meet Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) demands,” he says.",
      "“That includes recycling as well as reduction.”",
      "Currently, construction and demolition waste make up around half of New Zealand’s total waste going to landfill. Part of PlaceMakers ESG goal is to help bring that number down over the next few years. To do so, it will work closely with the construction industry.",
      "“We want to be a proactive organisation that works to reduce the amount of construction waste, rather than let stats like that remain the status quo,” says Nick.",
      "“Plastic wrap is a good place to start, given that the amount used to wrap one pallet is equal to hundreds of plastic bags. It’s an easy win for us to start there.",
      "“If we change the way we operate, we can potentially save over 15 tonnes of plastic from making its way into landfill every year.”",
      "To save more waste from damaging New Zealand’s environment, PlaceMakers is also partnering with Zero Plastic Oceans to trial the use of recycled Ocean Bound Plastic (OBP) as an alternative source of wrapping.",
      "OBP is plastic waste at risk of ending up in the ocean and is estimated to generate 80% of marine litter.",
      "During the trial period, OBP will be recycled into wrapping, and used when required.",
      "The scheme is part of a wider waste reduction initiative, which is also looking into further opportunities such as a trial to use paper-based strapping that can be easily recycled, which could be coupled with a strapping chipper that would chip strapping and recycle it.",
      "OBP is ‘Abandoned Plastic Waste’ (microplastics, mezzo-plastics and macro-plastics), located within 50km from shores where waste management is inexistent or inefficient. When already located in a landfill or managed dup site, the plastic waste is not considered as OBP. However, when abandoned in an uncontrolled or informal dump site, this waste is considered OBP.",

      "PlaceMakers is undertaking an NZ first by converting its fastenings range from plastic bags, clams, boxes and pails to cardboard boxes, starting with the loose nail range that will eliminate 55,000 poly bags and 60,000 plastic boxes going to landfill annually.",
      "“It’s the biggest change to loose nails in over 20 years, spearheaded by a category proud to say ‘we know a thing or two about fastenings’ and supported by Kiwi-supplier ECKO Fastening Systems Ltd,” says Dean.",
      "“The move is unique to New Zealand and provides a ground-breaking in-store customer experience that’s exclusive to PlaceMakers.”",
      "As a main supplier, ECKO Fastening Systems Ltd was keen to help.",
      "“At a supplier event about two years ago, PlaceMakers made it clear it was moving towards a more environmentally sustainable way of operating, and that packaging would be part of that,“ says ECKO’s National Sales Manager Shaun Matheson.",
      "“As a small Kiwi-owned company, we wanted to do our part, so we set out to create packaging that would be environmentally and customer friendly, and that could meet or even exceed PlaceMakers sustainable aspirations.“",
      "After extensive research and several trials, ECKO came up with a cardboard packaging robust enough to withstand a few falls and eye-catching enough for customers to recognise what it was.",
      "“There were a few challenges, such as finding out how to produce vivid colours on boxes without using gloss, and finding plastic-free tape strong enough to hold them together, but we got there in the end!",
      "The only plastic we have is in the viewing pane of some products, but even that will change in the future. So far it’s working well, and customers are telling us that this is exactly what they need.”",
      "It wasn’t an easy process for ECKO, but Shaun says it was well worth it.",
      "“Designing our packaging took a lot of cost and time and testing – but, for us, to be able to call ourselves 100% Kiwi, we need to look after our environment.”",
      "Some customers have done a double take to check they’re in the right aisle, in-store but quickly realise they are and have been impressed by the quality and presentation of the new packaging.",
      "“Customers have been really positive,” says Shaun. “After some initial surprise, a customer in the Hutt City branch couldn’t endorse the change enough – he said it was like getting rid of plastic bags in shops, a much-needed and very welcome change!”",
      "Comments aside, Dean says the numbers speak for themselves – more than 10,000 boxes have been sold during the transition over the past year.",
      "“We’re almost there with the loose nail change,” he says. “Auckland stores should complete the transition by the end of February, and then all customers can browse the loose nails range in the knowledge that they will see mainly biodegradable boxes on offer.",
      "“It’s great to see PlaceMakers placing importance on this, and working together with a local Kiwi supplier to make it happen.”",

      "In our pursuit of reducing landfill waste by 70% by 2026, PlaceMakers is actively working with suppliers to minimise packaging and adopt sustainable alternatives. This ambitious goal is driving us to implement robust frameworks and foster innovative partnerships. A notable example is our collaboration with ECKO, one of our major fastenings suppliers. ECKO has transformed their packaging from plastic to a sturdy, recyclable cardboard alternative. This initiative will prevent 55,000 poly bags and 60,000 plastic boxes from ending up in landfills each year. By harnessing supplier collaborations such as this, we are making significant strides toward a more sustainable future. Read more about this initiative here.",
      "Our commitment to sustainability drives us to actively reduce, reuse, and recycle to limit the waste going to landfill. To achieve this, we have significantly cut down on plastic wrapping for deliveries and introduced in-branch waste sorting stations to facilitate recycling and proper waste management. These efforts not only reduce our environmental impact but also engage our customers in making sustainable choices Learn more on the [Our Customers] page.",
      "Following a successful trial in our Auckland branches, PlaceMakers is transforming our timber packaging to reduce environmental impact. We are replacing our branded virgin plastic wrap with an unbranded recycled Ocean Bound Plastic (OBP) alternative. OBP includes plastic waste found within 50km of shores, particularly in areas lacking proper waste management. This proactive step helps prevent plastic from entering our waterways and oceans, aligning with our broader sustainability goals.",
      "With a large fleet operating nationwide, we recognise a significant opportunity to enhance sustainability through our transportation. We are excited to introduce electric tipper trucks into our fleet. These trucks offer all the functionality of traditional tipper trucks but with the advantage of being fully electric, thereby reducing oil consumption and emissions. Alongside this, many of our corporate vehicles have been upgraded to electric RAV4s, and we are in the process of replacing our utes with electric alternatives.",
      "In addition to electrifying our fleet, we have partnered with EROAD to optimise our vehicle management. EROAD's advanced systems help us improve efficiency and sustainability across our operations. By better managing our fleet, we reduce fuel consumption and emissions, enhance vehicle safety, and support our drivers' well-being by mitigating fatigue and preventing accidents. This initiative not only supports environmental goals but also contributes to social and economic sustainability.",
      "Another initiative we have explored was utilising hydrogen to help make our diesel-powered vehicles more efficient. To do this, we trialled the HYDI hydrogen on demand system. This system supplies hydrogen gas to a diesel engine’s intake, which has three times the energy content of diesel and improves combustion efficiency. By installing the hydrogen kit, we aimed to reduce fuel consumption, lower carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, and boost performance.",
      "In late July 2023, we installed the first hydrogen kit to test and verify the manufacturer's claims. Despite our high hopes, the trial revealed that the benefits did not meet our expectations and the benefits were not significant enough for widespread implementation. Nevertheless, this project exemplifies our commitment to experimenting with new technologies and continuously seeking ways to improve our sustainability practices.",
      "Vehicle idling is a common but often overlooked contributor to unnecessary fuel consumption and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To tackle this, we have implemented a comprehensive strategy to reduce idling time. This strategy includes the installation of idling switches, driver education and based KPIs based on idling reduction and thorough analysis of idling times. Through these initiatives, we aim to have reduced fuel consumption by 10% by 2026.",
      "In April 2023, we partnered with Carters Tyres and began using retread tyres for our truck fleet, rather than replacing worn tyres with new ones. Retread tyres, also known as recap or remoulded tyres, go through a remanufacturing process that replaces the worn tread on used tyres with new tread, extending the tyre's life.",
      "Each tyre sent for re-treading saves 60 litres of oil, 37 kg of CO2, and 50 kg of natural resources. Additionally, the cost of a re-tread tyre is approximately $300, about 60% lower than a new tyre.",
      "In July 2023, we further enhanced this programme by collaborating with Golden Bay Cement, which introduced a \"New Tyre Only\" policy. PlaceMakers now uses their tyres for re-treading, further reducing costs and increasing resource efficiency.",

      "PlaceMakers is dedicated to advancing sustainability through continuous evaluation and improvement of our practices. One significant area identified for enhancement was our use of plastic wrap for delivering building products, which often ended up in landfill after a single use.\nCustomer feedback played a pivotal role in shaping our approach. While some customers valued the weather protection provided by plastic wrap, many expressed that it was unnecessary for their needs while also adding to the waste they needed to deal with on site.",
      "In response, we implemented a proactive change which has since rolled out nationwide. Products, which would once have been wrapped, are now delivered without plastic wrapping as the default practice. The only exception to this is in cases of anticipated inclement weather or specific customer requests. To encourage sustainable choices, customers opting for plastic wrap incur a nominal $5 fee, donated entirely to Forest and Bird, New Zealand’s leading independent conservation organisation.",
      "This initiative has already made a significant impact, reducing plastic use by 60% in Auckland stores. We are committed to expanding this practice across all branches, ensuring ongoing progress towards our goal to achieve 70% landfill avoidance by 2026.",
      "In some branches, we are trialling sorting stations as part of our commitment to creating a circular waste journey and reducing landfill waste by 70%. These stations feature bins for various types of waste, including plasterboard and polystyrene, which are sent back to manufacturers for reuse in new products, and cardboard, which is recycled into new materials. Our sorting stations, accessible to both staff and customers, play a crucial role in our mission to minimise environmental impact and both staff and customers are encouraged to make use of them.",
      "We know that education is a powerful catalyst for change with regards to sustainability. We are dedicated to educating our staff on sustainable practices and equipping our customers with fresh ideas and insights on our initiatives. Through our bi-monthly Under Construction magazine, we regularly share articles about sustainability efforts within PlaceMakers and the wider industry. This resource provides valuable information for a new generation of tradespeople eager to engage with sustainable practices. You can explore these articles here.",
      "Additionally, our commitment to transparency is reflected in our ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) world reporting. These reports offer detailed updates on our sustainability progress within PlaceMakers and the broader Fletchers family, allowing stakeholders to track our performance and understand the metrics, processes, and certifications that support our initiatives.

      "Do you hate waiting for credits? What about having to chase merchants for weeks (or even months) after returning items to get your money or close out a job?",
      "At PlaceMakers, we believe that if you return products in saleable condition, we should give you a credit on the same day! The process has often been a challenging one for all parties – products are returned, someone writes down what they are, you receive a piece of paper, and then a credit appears sometime later.",
      "No matter the reason, we know it’s a key pain-point for our customers and are excited to be introducing an industry-first solution to alleviate this once and for all!",
      "Over the past few years, PlaceMakers has been working hard to deliver smart solutions to make it easier for you to engage with us. By now, you will be accustomed to our staff using handhelds to place your order, using our Yard App, so you don’t have to carry around pieces of paper, you get the right products, and nothing goes missing.",
      "Now, we are using these same handhelds to make processing product returns so simple, you will never have to worry about it again. If you don’t have a copy of your packing slip or invoice, no problem – our staff will be able to search for the product on any of your invoices, from anywhere in the branch. We will let you know straight away if the product is in an acceptable condition for refund and the credit will be created immediately – nothing more to do!",
      "As the credit is immediately in the system, it won’t get lost (unlike paper). In addition, we will take a photo of the products you’re returning, so that you can see exactly what you returned and reduce any disputes. This photo will be placed on the credit note with any notes around products that we couldn’t resell or return to the supplier.",

      "Updates to the acceptable solutions and verification methods under Clause H1 aim to help make new buildings warmer, drier and healthier, and therefore reduce the energy and environmental impact needed to heat them.",
      "The H1 Clause of the Building Code regulates the energy efficiency of the built environment – covering wall, floor and ceiling insulation, as well as the thermal performance of windows and doors. There are major increases in thermal performance requirements across the building envelope, indicated through higher construction R-values for different building elements.",
      "The new housing and small building insulation requirements are the same. The only difference between them is the transition date for the new final values to come into effect.",
      "Learn More",
      "Within the acceptable solutions and verification methods for H1 Energy Efficiency, there are three methods to comply with the minimum R-values for building.",
      "Learn More",
      "This method contains tables of minimum construction R-values for different building elements.",
      "Learn More",
      "This method includes simple equations and allows a building to have different insulation combinations.",

      "The new requirements for large buildings aim to reduce the emissions and energy used when heating and cooling a larger building by 23% on average over previous minimum status quo requirements.",

      "An R-value is the measure used to describe the ability of a material or system to resist the transfer of heat. The higher the R-value, the better the thermal resistance.",

      "The thermal performance of individual products eg, insulation.",
      "The total thermal performance (R-value) of a typical area of a building element. For a wall this would be derived from the R-values of the cladding, insulation material and a ‘typical area’ of wall framing.",
      "The Building Code clause H1 documents specify construction R-values, not the R-value of the insulation product to be installed.",
      "This is an important difference. For example, an R5.0 thermal ceiling insulation blanket may be used but the construction value of the ceiling may only be R4.0 once the total ceiling construction design is accounted for.",

      "Large building requirements differ from housing and small building requirements.",
      "Industrial, assembly service and ancillary buildings, as well as outbuildings, currently sit outside the scope of this work. However, where there is an office within a warehouse or industrial building that office would have to comply with the new requirements.",
      "Previously, New Zealand was divided into three climate zones – Zones 1 and 2 for most of the North Island and Zone 3 for the South Island and the central plateau. There are now six climate zones across New Zealand, and the new insulation requirements are tied to the zones.",

They built a large deck to accompany their new lawn, extend their entertaining area, and optimise the northwest view down the valley.",
      "Built in December 2021, the homeowners were on a tight timeline to finish the project before Christmas. The contractors, Forsight Builders, constructed the sub-frame but needed more time to finish laying the decking to meet the deadline. Luckily, PlaceMakers Warkworth supplied the materials on time, so family and friends were recruited to help finish the job. Under the watchful eye of the homeowner’s son, a builder’s labourer, the deck was complete after two full days. The hard work paid off, and Christmas Day was celebrated in style on the new deck.",
      "Premium pine timber was the decking material of choice for this project. A wider profile board of 140 x 32mm suited the character home, which features nine-inch weatherboard cladding. This deck is built close to the ground, and although there is ventilation under the deck, the homeowner felt a thicker 32mm board would be less likely to move. Finally, the decking boards were screwed down, rather than nailed, to provide a more sophisticated look. Pine timber is a cost-effective decking material that is sustainably sourced and will weather off to silver naturally.",

It needed to be contemporary; have flexibility in panel heights to work with their multi-level outdoor space; comfortably meet boundary consent requirements; and have a customisable option for one tricky panel.",
      "Mansion fence panels from Fentec were chosen as they provided a flexible solution that ticked all these boxes. The homeowners were delighted that a matching, custom-made panel could be ordered – something no one else could supply. This meant no compromise on aesthetics as the custom panel fitted in seamlessly.",
      "There were no challenges with stock supply or delivery, which resulted in a smooth installation. The fence panels were cut to size to suit the distance between each post, and were fitted using post caps and posts. The Mansion range is made from aluminium with a powder-coated finish. It is strong, durable, long-lasting, and suitable for home, and front fences too.",

      "Incredible views often mean that a site is exposed to the elements, and this new build home in the Coromandel is no exception – it sits in an extra-high wind zone. The challenge for this fence installation was to find a product that could withstand high winds but didn’t diminish the owner’s enjoyment of those expansive ocean views.",
      "It was a straightforward choice to use Scenik Frameless Glass Panels for this project. The panels chosen were 1200mm high and 12mm thick A-Grade toughened safety glass, rated to extra-high wind zones.",
      "Rather than the standard two spigots (mini posts) per panel, three were used here. The homeowners opted for the Scenik Tekapo base mount spigots which securely connected each glass panel to the composite decking, providing peace of mind and excellent durability against the weather.",
      "As well as coping with extra-high winds, fencing also needed to comply with the F9 building code clause for residential pools. Completed in late 2022, the total project (which included 52 metres of fencing) cost approximately $30,000.",
      "The Scenik Frameless Glass System wholly met the homeowner’s expectations – more than satisfying safety and security requirements, without compromising on luxury living and their all-important uninterrupted views to the coast.",

      "Increases to floor insulation are two-fold, differing over climate zone – as with all building elements – but also depending on whether you have a concrete slab-on-ground floor, or another type (most commonly suspended floors).",
      "The new minimum construction R-values are lower – R1.5 to R1.7 – for concrete slab-on-ground floors than for other floor types – R2.5 to R3.0. According to MBIE, this is because it’s much more challenging for slab-on-ground floors to achieve significantly higher R-values than with other types, such as suspended timber floors.",
      "However, even the small increase required for unheated slab-on-ground floors in the warmest four climate zones – a move from R1.3 to R1.5 – is greater than it appears. That’s because the background calculation method used for the 5th edition has changed. According to BRANZ, the increase is the equivalent of going to R2.0 under the previous approach. R1.5 means most slabs in buildings under 300m2will be specified with some combination of perimeter and under-slab insulation.",
      "In the future, MBIE expects that this differentiation between the floor types to be removed and slab-on-ground floors will need to achieve even higher levels of insulation.",
      "It’s unlikely that there will be a big shift in the types of products that can be used, but a change in the installation methods will be needed. For example, insulation added to non-slab-on-ground floors will no longer be able to be held in place with staples due to their increased thickness.",

      "Insulation is a barrier. It helps keep the heat in during the winter and can help keep the heat out during summer. This means that insulation is beneficial even in the warmest part of the country.",
      "To be effective, the barrier has to be continuous in the building. That’s why the changes to Building Code clause H1 Energy Efficiency look at insulating all parts of a building – including ceilings, walls, floors, windows, doors and skylights. Below is an overview of the changes to construction R-value requirements in different parts of a building, and how they can be achieved.",
      "The first phase of implementation – from 3 November 2022 – saw windows and doors in houses in all areas of the country require a rating of R0.37.",
      "This means minimum compliance can be achieved through a change in glazing, and specifically through the use of high-performance, double glazed Low E Insulated Glass Units (IGUs) in aluminium frames.",
      "Low E glazing achieves a lower rate of heat loss due to thin layers of silver or other low emissivity material on one side of the glass, which is enclosed in double or triple glazing to protect the coating. To achieve further insulation, inert gas like argon is used between layer of glazing.",
      "However, once requirements are lifted to R0.46 or R0.50, aluminium framing will not suffice. Thermally broken aluminium, uPVC or timber framing with double-glazed Low E IGUs will be required to meet or exceed the standard.",
      "For Zones 3, 4, 5 and 6, those higher R-values need to be met starting 1 May 2023. For Zones 1 and 2, requirements will be lifted to R0.46 on 2 November 2023.",
      "The thermal performance of doors has a significant impact on a building’s energy efficiency. The new H1 changes outlined here – for housing and buildings other than housing that are less than 300m² – now treats door thermal performance the same as windows",
      "The minimum R-value of doors and windows is currently R0.37 in Climate Zones 1 and 2; this will increase to R0.46 from 2 November 2023. It is already set at R0.46 in Climate Zones 3 and 4, and in Climate Zones 5 and 6, it is R0.50.",
      "A wide range of materials are used in door construction, some of which deliver better thermal performance than others. A common first step to meet the required R-value is to specify a thermally broken aluminium or composite door. Timber, uPVC, or fiberglass insulated doors can also significantly increase the R-value. If the door includes glazed sections, or is fully glazed, then low-emissivity, argon-filled double-glazing provides the highest R-value performance.",
      "There are three methods available in the new H1 compliance documents for showing that door thermal performance is compliant; these are schedule, calculation, and modelling.",
      "The new H1 requirements apply to glazed, partially glazed and opaque doors. ‘Opaque’ refers to timber, metal and other non-transparent material.",
      "Glazed doors count as part of the window area for H1/AS1 and, as such, they must have an R-rating that is the same as specified for the window joinery.",
      "A door that is partially glazed must assess compliance of the opaque area separately from the areas with glazing.",
      "Acceptable methods for determining the construction R-values of opaque doors or door panels are contained in NZS 4214.",
      "For partially glazed and opaque doors, the H1/AS1 schedule method may only be used if the opaque door area is no more than 6m2 or 6% (whichever is larger) of the total wall area.",
      "There are several permitted methods for calculating the R-rating for doors, depending on the method being used to show compliance. The intent is that the thermal performance of doors (both opaque and glazed and including the frame) would be calculated according to ISO10077-1 and ISO10077-2.",
      "Any house can demonstrate compliance using H1/AS or H1/VM1. Note there are extra requirements if the building has embedded heating systems."

      "In this episode, we venture into the Mighty Waikato. The team have their work cut out on this one but they are certainly up to the task. Kellie and Shane along with their team of faithful Tradies are going to knock down a wall to allow a lot more flow between the main club room and the courts. They are going to tackle the massive job of completely rebuilding the men’s changing room and add in a lot more privacy for the younger players. And just to make things that little bit more fun they are going to be building a mini grandstand so more people can enjoy the action. Catherine is really going to mix up the space with some dark walls and a super cool installation of squash rackets. For the changing room she is going all out it is going to go from zero to hero in no time at all. Izzy and Beaver really have their work cut out with this one. There is tension in the air as a duel between our two sporting stars is set to take place on court one. The weather is not looking good and even though we are working inside the entire team are going to have to dig deep to get this one across the line.",

      "Comfortech Building Performance Solutions® has developed a range of insulation solutions which can all be found at its H1 Hub ath1done.co.nz",
      "The traditional single layer segment installation methodology will no longer meet the new H1 requirements.",
      "This is because segment widths designed to fit between truss chords create a thermal chimney over the structure, which allows heat loss into the ceiling space. As R-values increase and calculations are based on more robust accounts for thermal bridging, the impact of this heat loss cannot be adequately offset.",
      "To address concerns about thermal bridging and heat loss between segments in ceilings, Comfortech® has developed the new extra-wide Pink® Superbatts® insulation. At 460mm wide, rather than the traditional 432mm, Pink® Superbatts® ensures a tight fit around the truss chords, with optional on-site notching to fully eliminate air gaps and airflow around structural members.",
      "Pink® Superbatts® is available as an R7.0 for compliance via the Schedule method and other R-values for compliance via the Calculation and Modelling methods; these will include Pink® SuperBatts® insulation R4.5, R5.0 and R6.0.",
      "In developing its two-layer solution, Comfortech® knew it needed a denser first layer to ensure the expected thermal performance was still delivered under the compression of the second layer, as two layers of R3.6 would not deliver an R7.2 once compression was factored in.",
      "Further to this, while typical truss bottom chords are 90mm or 140mm in height, Comfortech® identified that it needed to also accommodate for the fact that metal ceiling battens are hung below the truss chords and not fixed directly to them.",
      "Therefore, Comfortech® developed its two-layer solution, with the top layer of the two-layer system being R4.5 and the first layer R2.6 with a 110mm thickness for 90mm truss chord, and Pink® Batts® R3.0 with a 160mm thickness for 140mm truss chords. The extra 20mm thickness ensures the top of the first insulation layer aligns with the top of the truss chord and, when the second layer is laid over, that there are no pockets or paths for heat flow/loss that would reduce the effective performance.",
      "Under the new H1 regulations, the last 500mm of the perimeter of the ceiling insulation can be reduced to R3.3, allowing the insulation to be carried out over the top plates of the wall, while reducing the barrier to air flow from the eave edges.",
      "Adequate ventilation is critical to the performance of ceiling insulation. As R values increase, the temperature differential between the air below and above the insulation also increases, therefore increasing the likelihood of condensation occurring when the warm air from below meets the cold air above.",
      "With the increase in insulation thickness required to meet the 5th Edition of H1, Comfortech® also identified a potential increased risk of the insulation coming into contact with the underside of the roof and underlay, preventing ventilation of the ceiling space and creating a condensation and mould risk.",
      "Therefore, Comfortech® recommends installing an insulation guard for both the single and double layer system, over the roof trusses and under the roof underlay, before the roof is installed. The insulation guard ensures the minimum 25mm air gap is maintained even where the insulation is installed under compression out to the roof edge, over the top plate. This enables convective heat flow to remove moisture from the roof space, preventing condensation build, which would reduce the thermal performance.",
      "Skillion ceilings pose a unique challenge for achieving the new higher values, particularly via the Schedule Method.",
      "With rafters at 600mm centres or less, an R7.0 segment will not achieve the required R6.6 construction R-value. Therefore, Comfortech® has developed a new R7.4 single layer solution, suitable for skillion roofs with 290mm rafter depths.",
      "For rafters of less than 290mm depth, the Comfortech® solution is to use the R 6.0 Skillion \nRoof Pink® Batts® insulation with a second layer, at 40mm thickness, of R1.0 Pink® Batts® installed below the rafters, between the ceiling battens.",
      "This system addresses the thermal bridging issue and ensures the R6.6 construction can be achieved even in a skillion roof situation. Additional over-eave ventilation should also be considered, as the small volume of airflow in skillion roofs increases the condensation risk further.",

      "When things are set in stone, they really do last forever. Our natural stone pavers are made from the world’s abundant resources of porcelain, sandstone, and granite. Our porcelain is fired in super-hot furnaces, our handcrafted sandstone sourced from remote mines, and our granite is carved from giant blocks in quality-controlled quarries.",
      "Each paver is unique, some will have hairline cracks as part of their character. Others will have texture and natural blemishes from the way the rock has been split or fired.

      "Managing stormwater runoff around your property is an important and responsible action to take - especially with the increase of intensified urbanisation over recent decades. Reducing the impact on our stormwater infrastructure during severe weather events and allowing natural aquifers to recharge can be achieved in several different ways under council unitary plans. The most practical option for medium-to-high-density environments is an engineered permeable paving system which reduces the need for other retention structures such as ponds, swales, and sumps.",
      "Permeable paving creates a hardscape that allows water to flow through the enlarged gaps between the pavers (like the Firth Holland 80 FlowPave) or through an open paver design (like Firth Grass pavers) into an engineered drainage or retention system below.",
      "As water passes through the pavers, base course, and sub-base materials, there are two main benefits: the rate at which runoff enters our stormwater systems is greatly slowed, reducing the chances of them being completely overwhelmed, creating localised flooding problems. The second is the quality of the runoff water is greatly improved through filtering and sedimentation of any pollutants, so they are not discharging into streams and coastal waters causing erosion problems.",
      "For effective stormwater management, a permeable paving system must be installed and correctly designed/engineered by a suitably qualified person.",
      "Find a store near you",
      "Firth’s EcoPave range offers an extensive choice of permeable pavers. Available in a variety of styles, colours, and specific uses, they help manage stormwater flows around your property while creating practical and good-looking hardscapes that will last for years.",
      "Horizon’s Wai Pave permeable pavers offer an innovative solution to managing stormwater. Rainwater can pass through the pavers at a rate of 660mm per hour with zero runoff.",

      "Firth Gobi® Block is a robust paver that’s ideal for high traction requirements where a semi-grassed look is desired, such as hardstands for boats and caravans, sloping driveways, and access tracks. The open design allows grass to grow through for a more natural-looking surface while allowing water to drain into natural aquifers.",
      "If you want to maintain a grass look, but have the underlying strength of a paved surface, then Firth Grass Pavers are the ideal solution. Their wide openings allow a good amount of grass to grow through and water to filter through to drainage.",
      "These stylish square pavers have enlarged nibs to create gaps and enable stormwater to drain efficiently. This paver is available with two finish options: honed (premium semi-polished) and fair face (standard higher-tractions finish). This paver is available in theNorth Island onlyand needs to be laid by an accredited paver.",
      "A variant of the popular Firth Holland paver but with enlarged edge nibs for high permeability rates, the Firth Holland 80 FlowPave is ideal for driveways, paths, and areas where water run-off control is needed. This product uses chip for both bedding and jointing material (not sand).",
      "A variant of the popular Firth Holland paver but with enlarged nibs for high permeability rates and a halved face for a traditional street cobble effect, the Firth Holland 80 FlowPave Set is ideal for driveways, paths, and areas where run-off control is needed. This product uses chip for both bedding and jointing materials (not sand).",
      "The Firth Holland PorousPave has a high traction surface and standard edge nibs giving a patio or path a more seamless look while helping to manage water run-off. Unlike other EcoPave products the water can pass directly through the paver due to the specially designed no-fines concrete formulation giving it an open aggregate matrix (similar to a sponge).",
      "WaiPave is a sustainable answer to water runoff made from recycled porcelain floor tiles. Rainwater can pass through WaiPavers at a rate of up to 660mm/hour with zero runoff. Colourfast and strong, WaiPave is a circular solution for the environment.",

      "To protect the planter, McGowan installed a mowing strip with Dricon Ready Mix concrete. Armed with just a saw, sander and cordless drill driver (as well as his safety eyewear, earmuffs and gloves) Dean found building the box easy – and a great excuse to scope out more tools for other projects!",

Highroads Riverstones were an obvious choice, 100% sustainably sourced from the Mangatangi River, these attractive pebbles are an excellent low-maintenance stone for all kinds of decorative projects. Providing all year-round contrast in grey-gold tones they soften hard edges and introduce smooth reflective textures. Here they gently lead the eye through the grasses and flowering shrubs to the garden office and sun deck beyond. “The Riverstones were easy to use, looked great and were cost effective” the owners told us, they are also a natural choice for fishponds and planters.Riverstones are availablein 20kg bags in a range of sizes and colours.",
      "Working closely with a professional garden designer the owners were delighted to discover the benefits ofDaltons Coloured Mulchto support their vibrant cottage garden planting. Available in red or black, the mulch provides a ground cover that suppresses weed growth and increases soil water retention, so there’s far less weeding to do and the plants you love stay hydrated for longer. Using mulch is also known to encourage healthy microbial activity in the soil which in turn protects the plant’s root systems. The owners opted for the red mulch which contrasted well with the pebbles and greenery and was beautifully echoed in the Japanese acer and red cordylines.",

      "To provide an additional level of assurance, GreenStuf has the first BRANZ-appraised, double-layer system currently in the market. With the double-layer system, you will be able to achieve a minimum construction R-value of R6.6 and meet the H1 requirements for ceilings.",
      "The beauty of a double layer is that the two layers can be laid perpendicular to reduce thermal bridging. Alternatively, with 90mm trusses, the bottom layer of insulation will pillow over to reduce thermal bridging. Either of these solutions works.",
      "Additionally, our Thermal Ceiling Insulation R3.6 Blanket 140mm can be used in a double layer system. This will also allow you to achieve a minimum construction R-value of R6.6."

      "Timber sleepers can transform your outdoor spaces with their rustic ruggedness and character. Whether they’re used as retaining timber, formed into steps to make use of uneven ground, crafted into durable outdoor furniture, used as garden edging or in decorative raised gardens, wooden sleepers are a landscaper’s best friend. No other timber can match the look and appearance, plus sleepers are hard-wearing and can last decades with only minimal maintenance.",
      "If you choose to source reclaimed railway sleepers, you’re not only giving these durable items a new life, but they’ve also carried the weight of a railway network so you can be sure they’ll do the job of revitalising your outdoor space for years to come.",
      "Timber sleepers come in various hard- and softwoods, are available treated or untreated, and can come with rustic or clean finishes to suit any outdoor project. Some considerations to make when selecting a particular type of timber sleeper includes the available lengths and dimensions available, whether your sleepers will be used in a structural or garden application, and whether you’re after a clean or rustic look for your project.",

Ultra-dense and durable, even in very wet environments, Ironwood sleepers make a statement and are great for heavy-use applications, outdoor furniture, and bespoke designs. Some splits and cracks may be likely; these sleepers are also non-absorbent, so are not suitable for staining or treatments.",
      "These reclaimed oak sleepers have tight rings and are a dense wood, a result of their slow growth in the cooler European climates. Stone and steel indentations from possible ex-railway use, combined with the rich tone, make these perfect for achieving that rustic railway look.",

Long-lasting with a rich coppery tone, these sleepers – with their copper-based preservative that’s much more environmentally friendly than other treatments – can be safely used in raised gardens and play areas without a barrier.",

So please be aware that any steep banks, waterlogged ground, or heavy load-bearing walls will need firm footings with good drainage and may require specialist advice and council planning consent before you start work. We recommend reading ourGuide to Building Retaining Wallswhich includes notes on building consents and the retaining wall fundamentals.",

      "Gabion baskets are welded wire-mesh cages filled with pebbles or rocks that have been used to reinforce earth and prevent soil erosion for centuries. Scaled down for domestic landscaping, a gabion basket brings contemporary styling to a garden design whilst also affordable and highly functional as a retaining wall with bench-seating options.",
      "Using galvanised steel wire to ensure longevity, our gabion cages come in three sizes to suit a range of garden projects from low-level walls to taller structures, creating a striking backdrop for an outdoor dining area, property boundary, or terraced sun deck.",
      "Our gabions come pre-filled, or you can fill them with your choice of rocks or a mix of aggregates for a layered effect. We recommend our gabion or river rocks for durability and industrial aesthetic appeal, but you can stack them with bricks (whole or broken), tiles, or even coloured glass stones for a dramatic feature that will come alive at night with LED lighting.",
      "As a bold garden design tool, they can be planted to create a colourful living wall, raised flower bed or attractive lawn edging or, if non-retaining, used to shape hedging or filled with tall grasses to create natural geometrical structures in your garden. Why not alternate rock-filled gabions with evergreen-planted ones for a truly eye-catching feature wall. Your imagination is the only limit! See ourPlaceMakers Landscaping Guidefor more advice on their use and construction.",
      "A cost-effective solution, our gabion baskets are easy to install and low maintenance. The 4mm wire mesh grids of 75mm x 75mm squares redistribute forces evenly, so a slope or soil bank can be retained and stabilised. The natural spaces between the rocks allow water to drain freely, and the wires are galvanised to ensure the baskets remain rust-resistant. The lower height options can be topped with lengths of timber decking to create an attractive garden bench whilst the higher baskets can be fitted with outdoor lighting to illuminate a patio. There is the option to mix and match different-sized gabions to suit your project.",

      "For too long, Auckland homeowners, Anton and his partner, could not make full use of their backyard because of its steep grassy slopes. These not only became dangerously slippery when wet, but were a challenge to walk up or down even in the dry! It seemed a shame that their sheltered lower lawn, with a fire pit and woodland view, couldn’t be enjoyed far more often.",
      "A flight of timber steps seemed the obvious answer, but Anton wasn’t sure it was a project he could plan for or construct himself without professional support. As chance would have it, Anton saw an idea for radiata pine timber steps in ourPlaceMakers Landscaping Catalogue, and a friend had mentioned that he’d been pleased with the look and quality of our wood in his own backyard makeover.",
      "A call to our Warkworth team allowed Anton to discuss his ideas for the steps in more detail. This conversation helped him to consider the depth and tread of each one and learn which timbers would be within budget. Later Anton told us how impressed he’d been with the advice he received and the questions the team had raised; ‘They asked me if I was going to use the steps for seating as well’, a query which prompted the couple to agree this should be a feature of their final design. Throughout the process, Anton felt he was well supported to purchase the right materials for the job…",
      "‘With the help of the team and the landscaping guide, I got all the stuff I needed in one trip!’",
      "We checked back with Anton once he’d completed the job and asked him if the new steps had made a difference to their garden use. He told us they’d just carried food, blankets, and a few beers down the steps ready for an evening by the firepit so I guess that answered our question!",
      "Kiln dried radiata pineis sustainably grown here in NZ which means Anton’s steps not only look good but are eco-friendly, long-lasting, and resistant to the forces of nature too.",

      "The owners of this Papakura home have always known that a quality deck would transform their outdoor space and become the most well-used part of their property. So, following a series of home renovations, they set about turning their dreams into reality, designing a deck that would work from morning to night, in all weathers, throughout the year. A place to dine, entertain friends, relax by the fire, slip into the hot tub, and chill under the stars.",
      "An L-shaped home, they wanted to make the most of the area to the side of their property where a poor-quality timber deck had seen better days. Determined to create something stunning and long-lasting, they decided to invest in a multi-level hardwood timber deck, maximising every inch of the width they had. They studied their options and set their hearts on Tonka decking timber, sourced via a special order from PlaceMakers. Tonka is a reddish-brownhardwoodwith a fine texture and a waxy feel, ‘It’s such a beautiful-looking timber and extremely durable’ Lee told us, ‘We knew we wanted to use a high-quality hardwood to match our new fence’.",
      "Their first challenge was to remove the original deck and rebuild the supporting lower section ready for the new boards. At this stage Lee hired an electrician to install wiring for integrated deck lighting, cleverly avoiding the need to disturb floor timbers later on. The upper deck area was designed to be flush with their interior living space ensuring easy level access when their sliding doors were pulled back. Once done they planned to have a hardwood table and chairs here with shelter provided by their overhead pergola.",
      "A third of the top deck was designed to be open to the elements with relaxed seating and a tall brazier to make the most of dry evenings. A step down to the wrap-around second level would include a covered corner for the hot tub close to mature shrubs and the protection of the boundary fence. The lowest part of the deck would span the whole width of the space, creating a series of gentle steps to take the deck down to lawn level and the garden beyond.",
      "Homeowner Lee was keen to use only the best quality materials to fasten his timber deck opting for ourpremium Bremick Bronze Truss Head screwsto discretely match the hue of the Tonka wood. Though stained bronze these screws are made from tough stainless steel (T304 grade) so are the perfect choice for exterior projects. Once his deck was complete Lee choseDryden’s Hardwood Decking Oilfor the ultimate finish. With a built-in fungicide and its penetrating water-repellent properties this oil is the best defence against warping, splitting and weathering, and its resistance to ultraviolet light means that the glorious Tonka wood colour will stay protected far longer.",
      "Looking at the before and after photos, we’re sure you’ll agree that Lee has done a brilliant job here. We’ve been delighted to see our quality hardwood timbers put to such good use, a perfect partnership!

      "Using bricks from the villa’s original chimney to raise and retain a new outdoor space is a feature that Andrew and his partner Nicola proudly created by hand, with some expert bricklaying advice from the team at PlaceMakers! A large natural timber retaining wall has been back-filled with soil taken from under the house to create a flat area for socialising and backyard games of Corn Hole.",
      "To match the villa’s old Kauri weatherboards, Andrew selected 250mm Garrison bevel-back weatherboards from Claymark. The boards came pre-primed, making them easy to install and paint. The Dulux-trained staff at PlaceMakers helped the couple to choose paint colours and gave good advice on what type of paint to use.",
      "Local companyForsight Builderstook great care in completing all the major parts of the renovation. Andrew and Nicola expanded their DIY skills by installing an overlay Strata flooring from Woodland Lifestyle, putting in the Pink Batts, and painting the GIB themselves.",
      "“We had lots of fun completing this job, increased our DIY skills in a number of areas and, I have to say, we got great support from the team at PlaceMakers all the way,” says Andrew.",

      "This Auckland couple worked with a local construction company specialising in carpentry to design their luxury ocean-view home in the beautiful coastal town of Maraetai. Delighted with its sleek architectural lines and contemporary graphite finish, they came to us to source an attractive boundary fence to complement the look.",
      "OurElite aluminium modular fencingin charcoal was their first choice with its flawless finish, simple push-together system, and outstanding strength and durability. However, the scale of the project meant they couldn’t quite stretch to aluminium, so a more affordable solution with a similar aesthetic was needed.",
      "Our sustainableradiata pine fencesare supplied in a range of widths with a good choice of design and grain. The couple wanted a sleek, even finish on both sides of the fence so opted for one of our popular premium smooth decking timbers for the horizontal slats. To ensure their fence would stand the test of time, they chose H5 CCA treated posts and palings to provide extra strong protection from the elements, particularly surface groundwater. Keen to plan ahead, the couple followed current building code guidelines to ensure the fence would be tall enough for a later addition of a front yard pool. Their local PlaceMakers store in Pakuranga was more than happy to order in the longer 6M timbers required, which were sourced and delivered to the couple’s home within three days.",
      "Erecting the fence with our quality timbers was quick and problem free. Within a few days, the homeowners were able to add the finishing touches, electing to paint the smooth tactile panels with aDulux Timbacryl Acrylic Paint in Low Sheen Ebony. A high-opacity self-priming paint, this product has been specifically designed to blend with both the natural environment and today’s popular building materials. The couple were impressed with its fast drying same-day recoat properties, its ability to expand and contract with the climate, and its excellent 10-year durability guarantee. Above all, they loved how it perfectly matched the graphite timber facade of their new designer home!",
      "From start to finish, the couple had nothing but praise for their local PlaceMakers store both in terms of timber quality, customer service, and advice. Their property now has the privacy and protection they needed with a boundary fence that perfectly complements the design and finish of their forever coastal home.",

      "As a builder, Chris had experience with Outdure products on numerous projects and knew the benefits of ResortDeck. Being composite, it has the look of natural timber but none of the maintenance required, such as staining, oiling, or painting. It’s also stain- and fade-resistant – perfect for an entertaining area where spills are guaranteed.",
      "Chris is also a fan of the QuickBuild® aluminium deck framing system. It’s not only fast and easy to install with no visible fastenings, but the marine grade aluminium means it will last for years without rotting or warping.",
      "Outdure also provides a free deck and deck frame design service which automatically calculates the most efficient deck frame layout saving Chris a lot of time on cost estimation. The design even itemises all the materials and components required, which can then be ordered through PlaceMakers.",
      "Because the boards are available in the larger size of 140 x 32mm, fewer joins were required in the build - an important design consideration for this project. Although Kwila is known to leech when first installed, this wasn't too much of an issue. The deck installation was timed to manage the leeching, which was minimal and quickly washed away with the rain.",
      "Because the design side is so accurate there’s less waste, mess, or digging as you would have with a traditional hardwood timber deck.",
      "The family are thrilled with the finished deck, and their backyard has been totally transformed. “This is now our dream home. The kids cannot get enough of this newfound space and refer to it as the resort\".",

      "Pergolas are one of the oldest forms of architectural structures, the earliest can be traced back to Egyptian times to the gardens of Thebes. While uses have changed over time, pergolas are still a popular way to add structure and shade to gardens and homes, and to add a touch of class. Consisting of pillars and cross beams, pergolas have evolved from the large stone pillars of ancient times to more simplistic, stylish designs that can protect and extend your outdoor enjoyment, year-round.",
      "Whether free-standing or attached to your building, pergolas can be built from a range of materials to create a look that matches your home or landscape. Wooden pergolas are the natural place to start, and Kiwis have an abundance of choices. From NZ-grown radiata pine, engineered pine, or rustic Macrocarpa, to hardwoods like Kwila, or recycled hardwood rail sleepers. Modern homes might opt for an aluminium pergola which can be powder-coated to match the home and provides a lighter, easy maintenance solution.",
      "Looking to create your ultimate outdoor living area? We can help with that.",
      "Explore now:",
      "New Zealand radiata pine is an economical option and treated H4 or H5 for durability. Radiata is easy to work with and is relatively light. It will last, but expect some natural cracking or warping over the years. Leave it to naturally fade or paint or stain.",
      "Laminated pine is structurally engineered timber, made from premium radiata pine that has been finger-joined and laminated to produce a solid, straight, premium-looking product. Laminated pine is supplied pre-primed to prevent moisture ingress but will still require undercoating and top coating.",
      "With its golden hue and rural look, Macrocarpa is a Kiwi favourite – especially if you are looking to evoke a more rural feeling. Rough sawn or smooth, Macrocarpa brings solid character and warmth. Unless sealed, Macrocarpa will gradually silver in the sun. Note that Macrocarpa is not durable in-ground, so it is recommended that steel in-ground stirrups or brackets are used to secure your pergola.",
      "Recycled hardwoods bring a timeless story to your project. Their age, their dings, and dents all tell of years gone by. Recycled from railway sleepers or from old factory demolition sites, they add age and substance to your pergola and are always a talking point.",
      "Kwila is a Kiwi favourite and is found on decks and outdoor furniture throughout the country. This affordable hardwood is harvested from responsibly managed tropical forests. Reddish in colour, it greys over time and is available in posts and beams.",
      "If you’re looking for a modern addition to your outdoor living or thinking of adding a roof to your pergola, then a powder-coated aluminium pergola is a great option. Using the Span Bar system, these aluminium pergolas are both strong and elegant. Curved, single, and double-pitched pergolas can be designed, and when combined with our translucent roofing options, you can protect your outdoor area from the rain and the UV.",
      "This project involved levelling out the front lawn, retaining with Firth Keystone, and adding a new deck and fence - providing a stunning yet safe place for their toddlers to play.",
      "Learn how these Warkworth homeowners transformed their steep grassy slopes with a DIY flight of radiata pine timber steps.",
      "Andrew Shirley and his partner Nicola both had fun and learnt new skills while transforming the downstairs of their relocated villa into a new level area for entertaining.",

      "The traditional shiplap profile of overlapping timbers has a long history in NZ and remains popular because of its distinctive styling in both vertical and horizontal finishes. The shiplap profile continues to offer great value for money with superior timbers providing outstanding stability and a look that suits both traditional and contemporary designs. The shiplap profile allows boards to contract and expand without warping making them the ideal choice for more extreme climates or coastal locations.",
      "The board and batten profile is a traditional timber cladding system composed of alternate wide vertical boards and narrow wooden strips (battens). It offers a dynamic and versatile solution that has seen a resurgence in popularity recently. Creating a distinctly contemporary look with negative detailing and shadow lines it is well suited to a variety of modern building designs. Affordable, flexible and available in a range of woodgrain and smooth finishes this profile adds great visual appeal and can also be used as a partial siding with textured walls or other types of facade.",
      "The splay cut or angled-cut weatherboard profile is made up of boards that are cut at an angle to provide a chamfered edge on each side, producing a parallelogram shape. These boards are equally spaced apart offering a clean, contemporary shadow slat appearance.

      "Architecture and design are two elements that work in harmony to create a visually stunning and functional space that brings joy to the homeowners. This North Shore home built and finished in 2022 is a prime example of how architecture and design can come together to create an ultimate living space. With uninterrupted sweeping views over the reserve, the design of the house plays a pivotal role in amplifying the beauty of the surroundings. The house’s voluminous spaces are intelligently designed to draw the eye out to the world beyond. The spacious decks seamlessly blend with the living areas, creating a fluid transition between the indoor and outdoor spaces. The entertainment areas on both levels offer ample space to enjoy with friends and family, making it the perfect spot for socialising all year round. The brief: a monochromatic palette, privacy, and low maintenance were key factors in this project. The client worked closely with LC Designer Homes to bring his and wife Pauline’s dream home to life. As an integral part of the project, he wanted to be involved in the design process, collaborating with the team to ensure his design vision was met. LC Designer Homes’ commitment to collaboration made the process seamless, resulting in a home that is truly reflective of the client’s unique personality and lifestyle.",

The use of black monopitch roofs is a standout feature of the design, imparting a clean, contemporary, and minimalist look to the build. The mix of dark-stained vertical shiplap timber cladding, white bevel back cladding, and clean white plastered finished walls add interest to the exterior, with the colours standing out beautifully against the green backdrop of the reserve and sea landscape. The natural timber decks bring warmth and colour to the build, creating a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor living. The glass windows, doors, and glass deck balustrades are another highlight of the exterior design, giving the home a spacious and open feeling and connecting it to the surrounding environment. From every angle, the exterior of the home is a stunning composition of considered design and attention to detail, perfectly suited to its natural surroundings. Whether you’re relaxing on the deck or admiring the stunning views from inside, the exterior of this home is truly a work of art.",

      "The Building Act 2004 requires all new building work to comply with the Building Code, whether a building consent is required, or the work is exempt. However, when carrying out building work on an existing building, it becomes a bit more complex",
      "When carrying out building work to alter an existing building, the new work must comply with current code and section 112 of the Building Act, which says the building as a whole must to comply with the requirements of the Building Code to at least the same extent as it did immediately before the building work began and not make it worse When it comes to H1 Energy Efficiency, in a nutshell, the performance of the existing building does not need to meet current H1 requirements but needs to be at least as good as it was before it was altered.",
      "An example of this is an alteration where a new skylight is installed in an insulated roof. The R-value of the skylight must meet current code requirements, yet is still likely to be a lower R-value than that of the existing roof structure that it replaces. To ensure the overall performance of the building is not reduced, you will need to add sufficient insulation elsewhere in the thermal envelope to offset the loss in thermal resistance from the new skylight. This could be done by installing additional roof insulation in other areas.",
      "For an addition or extension to an existing building, all new construction must meet current code including the requirements of clause H1, but the rest of the building that is not being altered does not have to be upgraded to comply with the current H1 requirements.",
      "However, the altered building as a whole must continue to comply with clause H1 to at least the same extent as it did before the alteration. In other words, all new work must comply fully with current code requirements, and the energy efficiency of the building as a whole must not be diminished by the alteration.",
      "If the energy efficiency performance of the building is reduced because of the addition or extension, you will need to upgrade some of the existing building to ensure the building performs at least as well as it did before the alteration. In short, once the work is completed, the building as a whole is not required to meet the levels set in the current H1 acceptable solution – it just needs to continue to achieve the level of thermal performance it enjoyed before the addition or extension.",
      "An example of this is an extension of a living area, where an outer wall with one window and a timber door to outside is replaced with a wall of glazed bifold doors.",
      "The R-value of the living area overall is likely to be less than it was previously, due to the addition of substantial glazing; even though the glazing will have to meet the current H1 requirements. To ensure the overall performance of the building is not reduced, you will need to add sufficient insulation elsewhere in the thermal envelope to offset the loss in thermal resistance from the new extension with significantly increased glazing. This could be done by installing additional roof or wall insulation in other areas or possibly by bringing other windows in the living area up to the current H1 requirements.",
      "For like-for-like repairs or replacement of a small part of the building envelope, such as replacing a window, door or weatherboards, you should simply ensure the overall thermal resistance of a building is not diminished. An example of this is the replacement of an older, single-glazed window or door. This can be replaced by a single-glazed window of the same frame material, as the replacement joinery will perform to at least the same extent as the one being removed and is not required to comply with the current code requirements.",

      "The Building Act 2004 requires all new building work to comply with the Building Code, whether a building consent is required, or the work is exempt. However, when carrying out building work on an existing building, it becomes a bit more complex",
      "When carrying out building work to alter an existing building, the new work must comply with current code and section 112 of the Building Act, which says the building as a whole must to comply with the requirements of the Building Code to at least the same extent as it did immediately before the building work began and not make it worse When it comes to H1 Energy Efficiency, in a nutshell, the performance of the existing building does not need to meet current H1 requirements but needs to be at least as good as it was before it was altered.",
      "An example of this is an alteration where a new skylight is installed in an insulated roof. The R-value of the skylight must meet current code requirements, yet is still likely to be a lower R-value than that of the existing roof structure that it replaces. To ensure the overall performance of the building is not reduced, you will need to add sufficient insulation elsewhere in the thermal envelope to offset the loss in thermal resistance from the new skylight. This could be done by installing additional roof insulation in other areas.",
      "For an addition or extension to an existing building, all new construction must meet current code including the requirements of clause H1, but the rest of the building that is not being altered does not have to be upgraded to comply with the current H1 requirements.",
      "However, the altered building as a whole must continue to comply with clause H1 to at least the same extent as it did before the alteration. In other words, all new work must comply fully with current code requirements, and the energy efficiency of the building as a whole must not be diminished by the alteration.",
      "If the energy efficiency performance of the building is reduced because of the addition or extension, you will need to upgrade some of the existing building to ensure the building performs at least as well as it did before the alteration. In short, once the work is completed, the building as a whole is not required to meet the levels set in the current H1 acceptable solution – it just needs to continue to achieve the level of thermal performance it enjoyed before the addition or extension.",
      "An example of this is an extension of a living area, where an outer wall with one window and a timber door to outside is replaced with a wall of glazed bifold doors.",
      "The R-value of the living area overall is likely to be less than it was previously, due to the addition of substantial glazing; even though the glazing will have to meet the current H1 requirements. To ensure the overall performance of the building is not reduced, you will need to add sufficient insulation elsewhere in the thermal envelope to offset the loss in thermal resistance from the new extension with significantly increased glazing. This could be done by installing additional roof or wall insulation in other areas or possibly by bringing other windows in the living area up to the current H1 requirements.",
      "For like-for-like repairs or replacement of a small part of the building envelope, such as replacing a window, door or weatherboards, you should simply ensure the overall thermal resistance of a building is not diminished. An example of this is the replacement of an older, single-glazed window or door. This can be replaced by a single-glazed window of the same frame material, as the replacement joinery will perform to at least the same extent as the one being removed and is not required to comply with the current code requirements.",
      "Schedule 1 of the Building Act Exemption 1 allows you to repair, maintain or replace building elements without needing to obtain a building consent, provided a series of conditions is met.",
      "The Building Code clause H1 documents specify construction R-values, not the R-value of the insulation product to be installed.",
      "This is an important difference. For example, an R5.0 thermal ceiling insulation blanket may be used but the construction value of the ceiling may only be R4.0 once the total ceiling construction design is accounted for."

      "Heat pumps are a versatile and energy-efficient solution that will keep your home warm in the winter and cool over summer, offering year-round comfort for any New Zealand home. By utilising the natural warmth present in the air or ground, they transfer heat indoors, and in doing so produce more heat energy than the electricity they consume, making heat pumps a cost-effective home heating solution. Whether you prefer a wall-mounted heat pump, floor console, or even a ducted system, we have the perfect model for your home.",
      "For what to consider when choosing the right heat pump for your home, read our selection guide.View Guide",
      "Gas fires offer a warmth and elegance, perfect for creating a cosy and inviting space in any New Zealand home. With their realistic flame effects, they provide the charm of a traditional wood burner without the maintenance. With the flick of a switch, you’ll be luxuriating in front of a warming gas fire that quickly heats the room and creates instant ambience. Whether integrated into a modern design or a classic setting, gas fires bring comfort, style, and efficiency to your home with ease.",

Many of our models can be used to heat your water supply, helping to cut down on power bills and keep you warm through power outages.

      "Electric panel heaters offer a convenient and efficient solution for keeping your living spaces warm. Designed to provide consistent and gentle heat distribution within a room, there sleek and slim profile is unobtrusive and easy to integrate into various interior aesthetics without occupying valuable space. Easy installation and low maintenance further contribute to their appeal, making electric panel heaters an energy-efficient and convenient solution for maintaining optimal comfort throughout your home.",
      "Utilising gas as a heat source is a fast and efficient way to heat air. Flued gas appliances provide fast, dry heating solutions for your home. Gas burns much hotter than electric coil alternatives, and gas appliances are not affected by external air temperatures — meaning that the air delivery will be the same temperature no matter what is going on outside.",
      "In New Zealand we use two forms of gas: Natural Gas, which is reticulated around most towns in the North Island and LPG which is stored in bottles and available across New Zealand from various companies. Flued heating appliances are a preferred option — as the by-product of the burnt gas is expelled outside — eliminating inside moisture issues. In the South Island Natural Gas is not available, gas consumers must use bottled or reticulated LPG.",

      "PlaceMakers Heating offers a selection of outdoor approved heating for areas small or large in electric, gas or fire pit models, to suit all your needs. Kiwis love outdoor living but with unpredictable weather an outdoor heating solution is often required to take the chill out of the air. Investing in outdoor heating allows you to stay comfortable outdoors and entertain all year round and create the perfect ambiance for your family and guests. Outdoor heating is also a great option for cafes, bars, and public outdoor entertainment areas.",
      "Ventilation helps the circulation of fresh air through your home. It allows moisture and airborne pollutants to escape, and fresh clean air to be drawn into your home resulting in better air quality. The importance of ventilation in our homes is often overlooked but the benefits are clear and significant in keeping your family healthy. These benefits include preventing mould & mildew, protecting against dust mites, and reducing vapour and moisture which in turn reduce the risk of virus infection, asthma, and other respiratory problems. Ventilation solutions like Heat Transfer options can be a good add on to your chosen heating solution. They are a great way to utilize excess warm air from living rooms that feature solid fuel burners, to provide some heat to the bedrooms via a ducted system in the ceiling.",
      "A bathroom heater is a great addition to keep you and your family warm in winter after a bath or shower, and to heat the room ensuring comfort during the cooler months. A bathroom heater will help keep the room dry, clean, and healthy by reducing mould and mildew. There are several solutions available, whether you require wall or ceiling mounted, fan assisted or timed PlaceMakers has you covered.",
      "Ceiling fans are a practical and stylish addition to your home. Beyond their primary function of circulating air for cooling, they often incorporate lighting fixtures to provide a dual-purpose solution. With a variety of styles, sizes, and finishes available, they seamlessly integrate into diverse room decors. Energy-efficient and cost-effective, ceiling fans offer an alternative to traditional air conditioning, contributing to a comfortable and well-ventilated environment in both residential and commercial settings.",

      "A fireplace is a fantastic addition to any living space, offering so many benefits that everyone can enjoy. In addition to a cosy ambience, it can improve the overall value and aesthetic appeal of a room, providing a perfect focal point for family gatherings and romantic evenings. A fireplace can also serve as an efficient heating source, reducing energy costs during the colder months.",
      "When it comes to adding a fireplace to your home, there are numerous factors to consider, including lifestyle, the size of your room, how often you'll use the fireplace and what fuel you prefer. Consider your daily routine and how a fireplace would fit into it, and make sure there’s enough space for it to be placed in a safe location.",
      "PlaceMakers sellsgasandwoodfireplaces, and there are pros and cons to both.",
      "Gas fireplaces are a great choice for those looking for an efficient and clean heating source.",
      "They typically use natural gas or LPG and are known to have fast heat output, making them an ideal choice for colder climates. Additionally, gas fires can be turned on or off with the simple click of a switch, giving you complete control over your heating needs. Unlike a wood-burning fireplace, there’s no mess from newspapers, fire-starters, wood splinters, bark or ashes.",
      "Several types of gas fireplaces are available, including traditional vertical-flued, direct vent, and power-flued.",
      "While you do need a council consent for a wood burner, that is not a requirement for a gas fire. Instead, gas fires are certified by gas fitters, who take full responsibility for the installation process and will issue you with a Gasfitting Certificate of Compliance.",
      "You can find more about New Zealand gas fitters at the Plumbers, Gasfitters and Drainlayers Board websitehere.",
      "It’s important to note that, if building work around the fireplace is required, this may require building consent.",
      "It’s possible to retrofit a gas fireplace into existing open fires and as a replacement for built-in wood burners; however, placement of gas fireplaces has evolved from the traditional locations in family or living rooms.",
      "Today’s interior design trends place them in any room where ambiance and warmth are desired, which can be just about any room in the house!",
      "There are also see-through and multi-sided fireplaces, which can be enjoyed in more than one room at a time.",
      "Thanks to innovative heat transfer systems, the warmth generated from the fire is not limited to the room in which it is placed but can be moved around or outside the house as desired.",
      "Wood fireplaces add a classic and cosy ambience to any home. They use logs as their main fuel source and are usually installed in homes with an existing chimney.",
      "Well-operated, modern wood burners are energy efficient, produce low levels of air pollution and use one of NZ’s most renewable forms of energy. When lit, wood fires also add incredible atmosphere to a space that is hard to match.",
      "Installing a wood burner requires a building consent, no matter where you live in New Zealand. You must have a building consent before you install, move or substantially change a fireplace or solid fuel heater to make sure that it’s installed properly and is safe to use.",
      "To lodge the consent, you'll need detailed information about how the work to install the fireplace or wood burner will meet the Building Code. If you don't have building industry experience, you may want to ask the tradesperson installing the fire to manage the building consent process on your behalf.",
      "Radiant fires offer an intense, toasty heating effect – ideal if you’ve got high ceilings or poor insulation. Convector fires produce a softer, ambient heat through a cyclic convection effect. They heat more evenly but are better for homes with good insulation and low ceilings. Many models are 'radiant and convection', combining both heating modes.",
      "If you live on a property smaller than two hectares, you need to install a wood burner that meets National Environmental Standards (NES). This means they have emissions of less than 1.5 grams of particles for each kilogram of dry wood burned, and a thermal efficiency of at least 65%.",
      "Models that meet these standards are also known as clean air or urban models, and most PlaceMakers wood burners are NES-compliant.",
      "The Ministry of Environment has an up-to-date list of authorised wood burners that met the requirements of the NES at the time of testing. Pellet burners that have been tested and found to meet the NES for Air Quality standards for wood burners are also listed.",
      "This requirement applies to all new wood burners installed from 1 September 2005. It applies even if you are replacing an older model or moving an existing wood burner to another location within the same house.",
      "If you live on a property two hectares or larger, you can still install wood burners that do not meet the National Environmental Standards for Air Quality.",
      "Open fires, multi-fuel burners, pellet burners and wood-burning cooking stoves are not included in the definition of wood burner, so are not covered by these standards.",
      "There is no Ministry of Environment list of authorised multi-fuel burners (including coal burners) or open fires, as these are not recommended forms of heating because of the increased particulate matter emissions they produce. In some regions, councils may specifically control these forms of heating through rules or by-laws.",
      "ULEBs are a new technology designed for installation in areas where older burners are outlawed. These burners meet stringent standards and are able to be installed in clean-air zones where all other fires are prohibited. They’re also highly efficient.",
      "Depending on where you live, NES compliance might not be enough. New Zealand has strict air quality guidelines that determine which wood fires can be installed by region. The country is split into two zones – Clean Air Zones and Non-Clean Air Zones, with Clean Air Zones having specific requirements and restrictions. These are outlined below:",
      "Rotorua Clean Air Zone:From 1 November 2017, only wood burners that have an emission discharge of 0.60 grams of particles for each kilogram of dry wood burned can be installed in homes in the Rotorua Airshed.",
      "Nelson Clean Air Zone:If you are replacing a current wood fire, a low emission burner (NES-compliant) needs to be installed. If you are building a new project, an ultra-low emission burner (ULEB) needs to be installed.",
      "Rural models allowed on sections larger than two hectares are also available through PlaceMakers. They generally offer better overnight-burn capability than urban models, ideal for farmers keen for their fire to still be burning when they wake early in the morning. The trade-off is higher emissions and lower efficiency.",
      "Working out the heating capacity (kW) required for your home is critical. Wood burners lack the fine control of a heat pump – too small and it won’t be able to keep your home at a healthy temperature, too large and you risk turning your home into an uninhabitable oven. As a rough guide, models under 10kW are best suited for smaller, well-insulated spaces, while large and/or poorly insulated spaces need more than 10kW.",
      "For a more accurate gauge on the ideal output for the area you want to heat, useConsumer NZ’s calculator.",
      "If you have an existing open fireplace, you can opt for an insert wood burner that fits inside the old fire cavity; however, it’s less efficient as you lose heat up the chimney. Free-standing models are the best option for newer households and can now be placed closer to walls with smaller clearances than older free-standers.",
      "For more information on operating your wood burner efficiently and responsibly, what type of wood can be burned, modifications and more, visit the Ministry of Environment’s Frequently Asked Questions page on wood burners.",

      "Choosing the right heating for your home can be complicated, but it doesn’t need to be! Learn more about selecting the right heat pump for your home below.",
      "Many New Zealand homes are notoriously under-equipped for the winter months, leaving a lot of homeowners feeling the cold or struggling to keep their energy costs down. This is due to a number of factors, including poor insulation and damp conditions – but inadequate heating is a big part of the problem too.",
      "A heat pump may be the ideal solution, as they are more convenient than wood or pellet fires, and are safer and more efficient to use around children and pets than either of those options, as well as gas or electric heaters. They can also be used for both heating and cooling, providing year-round comfort.",
      "Heat pumps don't create heat, they simply move available heat from one place to another. As a result, heat pumps are one of the most energy-efficient forms of heating available in New Zealand.",
      "Most people now know that homes need to be kept at a temperature of 18-20 degrees Celsius to be healthy, but not everyone understands how heat pumps can maintain temperature without costing the earth.",
      "Below is a quick rundown of some of the latest heat pump technologies and features, and what the terminology you might see on different products means. This will hopefully make it easier for you to choose a model that will keep you comfortable, while lowering your energy use, environmental impact, and bills!",
      "Human activity sensors can monitor human body locations in a room, including movements and absences. Energy and heat automatically adjust to human activity, such as increasing cooling settings when a room is full (of warm bodies) or turning off when the room is empty. This auto-adjustment keeps energy use (and power bills) to a minimum.",
      "The sun is our most valuable (free) source of heat, and it can really affect the temperature inside a room with heat transfer through walls and windows. Sunlight sensors auto-detect heat and adjust to increase/decrease temperature to make the most of this free resource, whether it’s overcast and cool, sunny and warm, day or night.",
      "Using Wi-Fi, you can control your heat pump remotely from your sofa, elsewhere in your home, or even out and about. This feature is great if you’ve forgotten to use your pre-programmable settings or when things change – such as the weather, or your own plans! This feature is now commonly available as an add-on or built-in to certain models.",
      "Filtration systems can help to remove unwanted particles from the air, such as bacteria and mould spores. Some systems and filters can de-activate up to 99% of bacteria and viruses, plus deodorise bad smells. Some models are accredited by Asthma NZ.",
      "Historically, the most widely used heat pump refrigerant in New Zealand was HCFC-22 (known as R22). This has a moderately high greenhouse warming potential (GWP) and low ozone depletion level (ODP). As part of the Montreal Protocol, the NZ Government is phasing out HCFCs, so since January 2015, more refrigerants with less environmental impacts have become available. According to Sustainability Trust, R32 is currently a good choice of refrigerant.",
      "Heat pumps are a popular addition to most homes, given that they deliver heat  generally at 3:1 above the kilowattage drawn off the grid. In practice, this means that for every 1kW of energy drawn, they give out 3kWs of heat.",
      "The heat pump must be powerful enough to heat or cool the room sufficiently, otherwise the unit will run flat-out constantly and struggle to get the room to temperature. This will result in high running costs and frequent defrost cycles on the colder nights and mornings.",
      "It is also important not to install a unit too big for the area, otherwise it will be draughty, noisy, and turn on and off all the time, giving you an uneven room temperature and unnecessary annoyance.",
      "Choosing an oversized heat pump for a living area and hoping to heat the entire house is not effective in most situations. Certain home layouts can benefit from a small amount of heat flow to other rooms, but the location and capacity of the unit must be carefully considered.",
      "A very general rule of thumb (indicative only) is that 0.12kW of power is required per square metre of the room’s footprint – so a 50m2 room might require a 6kW heat pump.",
      "It’s important to remember that size isn’t everything. When it comes to your home, you also need to consider how well insulated it is, the orientation, and your local climate.",
      "For a home that is insulated in the floor, ceiling, and walls, and double-glazed, use a factor of 50. Increase this by 5 for anything that may be lacking in the home (no insulation or double glazing requires a factor of 65).",
      "It’s best to choose a heat pump that is a bit higher than your calculation, so that it’s not overworked.",
      "Single-split systems & Multi-split systems",
      "A single-split system is the most common heat pump in New Zealand, with one outdoor unit connected to an indoor unit that heats the room it’s installed in. Single-split systems are pretty easy to have installed and they're also cost-effective.",
      "Multi-split systems connect one outdoor unit to multiple indoor units to heat different rooms in your home. These systems are good options for  larger homes, or if you want to have several indoor units without having multiple units outside. With both single and multi-split systems, you can choose from a floor console, ceiling console, ceiling cassette, or high-wall unit.",
      "You do not need a qualified and registered person to install the heat pump.",
      "You do need a licensed electrician to connect the unit to the electrical supply. You should receive an Electrical Certificate of Compliance and Electrical Safety Certificate post installation.",
      "In most cases, especially residential, installing a heat pump doesn’t require a building consent. However, making a penetration through the building exterior increases the chance of incoming moisture, and most external walls are load-bearing, so the position of the penetration should be considered carefully.",
      "Making a hole up to 300mm through an external or internal wall doesn't usually require a consent.",
      "However, before you undertake any work involving external wall penetrations, you should get professional advice.",
      "Heat pumps should be correctly installed and located as far away from property boundaries as possible, to avoid creating excessive noise for neighbours.",
      "When heat pumps are installed incorrectly, they can exceed noise level limits – particularly at night. It’s also worth noting that some heat pumps are noisier than others, and you don’t want to disturb you, your family, or your neighbours if the one you choose could do so.",
      "If you live in an apartment, shared walls will need to be considered and a suitable location, such as a balcony, be identified to install the outdoor unit.",
      "The information provided in this article has been collated from Ministry of Environment, Sustainability Trust, Consumer NZ, government agency Gen Less and heat pump suppliers.",

      "The owners of this Papakura home have always known that a quality deck would transform their outdoor space and become the most well-used part of their property. So, following a series of home renovations, they set about turning their dreams into reality, designing a deck that would work from morning to night, in all weathers, throughout the year. A place to dine, entertain friends, relax by the fire, slip into the hot tub, and chill under the stars.",
      "An L-shaped home, they wanted to make the most of the area to the side of their property where a poor-quality timber deck had seen better days. Determined to create something stunning and long-lasting, they decided to invest in a multi-level hardwood timber deck, maximising every inch of the width they had. They studied their options and set their hearts on Tonka decking timber, sourced via a special order from PlaceMakers. Tonka is a reddish-brownhardwoodwith a fine texture and a waxy feel, ‘It’s such a beautiful-looking timber and extremely durable’ Lee told us, ‘We knew we wanted to use a high-quality hardwood to match our new fence’.",
      "Their first challenge was to remove the original deck and rebuild the supporting lower section ready for the new boards. At this stage Lee hired an electrician to install wiring for integrated deck lighting, cleverly avoiding the need to disturb floor timbers later on. The upper deck area was designed to be flush with their interior living space ensuring easy level access when their sliding doors were pulled back. Once done they planned to have a hardwood table and chairs here with shelter provided by their overhead pergola.",
      "A third of the top deck was designed to be open to the elements with relaxed seating and a tall brazier to make the most of dry evenings. A step down to the wrap-around second level would include a covered corner for the hot tub close to mature shrubs and the protection of the boundary fence. The lowest part of the deck would span the whole width of the space, creating a series of gentle steps to take the deck down to lawn level and the garden beyond.",
      "Homeowner Lee was keen to use only the best quality materials to fasten his timber deck opting for ourpremium Bremick Bronze Truss Head screwsto discretely match the hue of the Tonka wood. Though stained bronze these screws are made from tough stainless steel (T304 grade) so are the perfect choice for exterior projects. Once his deck was complete Lee choseDryden’s Hardwood Decking Oilfor the ultimate finish. With a built-in fungicide and its penetrating water-repellent properties this oil is the best defence against warping, splitting and weathering, and its resistance to ultraviolet light means that the glorious Tonka wood colour will stay protected far longer.",
      "Looking at the before and after photos, we’re sure you’ll agree that Lee has done a brilliant job here. We’ve been delighted to see our quality hardwood timbers put to such good use, a perfect partnership!

This stunning product is a thermally modified, clear grade timber, sourced from managed forests in West and Central Africa. Made from Ayous timber and the latest thermal modiﬁcation technology, which involves applying heat at above 200°C, water vapour and pressure to the timber. The thermal treatment produces a rich Teak coloured board that's both durable and stable without any chemical treatment, resins or glues – just heat and wood.  Truwood is considered more durable than other naturally durable cladding and is the most popular modified cladding in Europe.",

The western red heartwood displays stunning variations in colour - from dark brown and pink when fresh, turning to silver-grey when weathered. It's straight grained with a coarse texture and has a very low shrinkage factor. Because it machines and holds a stain well, it is the cladding of choice for many architecturally designed homes. Innovations include 20mm and 45mm cavity batten systems, a range of extruded junction flashings, and the popular INTERSET® recessed window flashing system.",

      "At PlaceMakers, we take pride in being the industry's go-to plywood experts, committed to serving both seasoned builders and DIYers alike. With a comprehensive range that spans all types of ply, from form to marine and structural to non-structural ply, we've got you covered for every project.",
      "We understand that choosing the right plywood can be a critical decision, and that's why our range not only offers incredible breadth and unparalleled depth. Our commitment to quality ensures that you'll find the perfect product for your job. Explore our extensive plywood range, and let us be your trusted partner on your journey to building success. PlaceMakers - where expertise meets inspiration, and the right product is just a click away.",
      "Form plywood is specifically manufactured for use in making concrete forms. Strong and stiff, form plywood is overlaid with heavy-duty, phenolic resin paper on one or both sides to create a non-stick surface. This prevents the concrete from adhering to the form and enables easy removal and re-use of the form plywood. The water-repellant overlay paper also prevents moisture from the concrete from damaging the plywood veneers and creates a smooth finish to the concrete. This saves construction time and labour on finishing grinding. When used for concrete subfloors, form plywood must have an F stress grade rating.",
      "Exterior cladding plywood can be an inexpensive way to clad a house or other lightweight structures or to add accents to a design. Available in either a grooved or rough sawn finish, cladding plywood can be either painted or stained to achieve a variety of looks. Strong, yet lightweight, these treated panels are made from New Zealand Radiata Pine and have vertical shiplap joints for easy and watertight installation. As non-bracing cladding, they are manufactured to achieve a minimum of 15 years’ durability*. Plywood cladding cannot be used for all buildings, and you should check the manufacturer’s specifications. A full range of aluminum flashings are available to make installation easy. *In accordance with NZBC Clause B2 Durability.",
      "Roofing Plywood is a structural grade plywood with a plastic tongue and groove down the long edge of the sheet for easy joining over roof trusses. As a structural ply, it is certified to AS/NZS 2269 and available in F8 stress grades and higher. When laying roofing ply, the sheet should always be laid perpendicular to the roof truss to achieve the maximum structural strength, and the sheets should be staggered. Roof ply comes in an unsanded DD surface grade which gives roofers extra grip when installing. As a roofing substrate normally used under shingles or bitumen, care needs to be taken to seal any cut edges with a preservative treatment.",
      "As the name suggests marine plywood is primarily used for boat building, where its superior qualities of strength, consistency and impact resistance have made it the “go to” material for decades. But marine ply also suits a wide number of applications where moisture can be an issue. Kitchens, laundry areas - even saunas and swimming pool changing rooms are ideal locations for marine ply. The main difference with marine ply is the waterproof resin (glue) between each of the thin layers of wood. As well as the resin, marine ply must be constructed to British Standard. But even with these elements, marine ply still needs layers of treatment to maximise its lifespan. The rule of thumb is a layer of epoxy sealant per layer of wood in the ply. Due to its special nature marine plywood is available from PlaceMakers on special order.",
      "Interior plywood lining is easy to use, comes in a range of profiles, wood types and colours that help homeowners and designers create amazing finishes. Whether you're after a clean, natural look or a traditional 'V' groove effect - plywood is an economical answer. Improved bracing characteristics mean some new interior plywood panels can now be attached directly to the house framing - instead of over gib board. This can save homeowners plenty of money on their project. From garages to tiny homes, or to sleek Scandinavian look high-end residences, plywood linings are proving more popular than ever.",
      "Plywood is one of the most popular flooring sheet products as it has excellent strength and bracing properties and is easy to install and maintain. Ply flooring is ideal for residential, commercial, and industrial projects. The most common thickness for ply flooring is 19mm and the most common treatment is H3.2. Treated ply flooring should be used for the “wet” areas such as bathrooms and laundries, however, some builders prefer to take the extra precaution of using H3.2 treated plywood for the entire building. Flooring ply is available with a tongue and groove (T&G) edge system for easy interlocking. Sheets must be laid perpendicular to the floor joists.",
      "Only structurally tested plywood has a strength rating using an 'F' rated system. Any plywood without a strength rating is considered “non-structural”. Architects, engineers and builders need to know the strengths of the components when designing and constructing a building. Depending on the application of the plywood, this will determine what the minimum rating and thickness needs to be. Structural plywood needs to be treated for exterior or wet area use.",
      "Non-Structural Plywood is a great solution for projects which don’t need to provide structural performance or load-bearing qualities. It’s a great option for temporary hoardings, small projects such as building a dolls house and non-structural packaging. Non-Structural Plywood is available in both treated and untreated sheets and in a range of thicknesses. Generally, it is a lower grade of plywood and may have open face knots and surface inconsistencies which reflect the practical nature of the product.",
      "This hardwood veneer is pressed onto a poplar core giving it an appealing aesthetic while keeping the cost of the product to an affordable level. No sanding or stopping required when using for an interior lining solution, with its pre-sanded faces you can paint or stain it.",
      "Perfect for joinery and higher spec builds",

      "While building specifications are hard and time-consuming to change mid-build, new plywood products with approved bracing units and appearance grade facing are now available in New Zealand, and at Placemakers.",
      "We’re not just the shaky isles, we’re the windy isles. House frames move in high wind zones, so wall linings need to have a certain amount of extra bracing. The Building Code NZ3604:2011 specifies the minimum bracing capacity for wind and earthquakes. The bracing demand to resist wind is expressed in Bracing Units or B/Us per lineal metre or per square metre for earthquakes. Architects and engineers refer to tables to calculate the correct bracing application for each build, bearing mind its structure, location, and orientation.",
      "Plasterboard changed the game by getting consent for its inherent bracing properties included in the bracing calculations. This meant fewer additional fixings and fastenings were required in the build, saving construction time and money. But it only applied to plasterboard. Even if plywood was used, you still needed to add plasterboard behind the ply to meet building standards.",
      "Now there’s an improved range of bracing ply that meets the bracing units required to pass consent. You no longer need to include plasterboard behind the ply, so you can save time, 10mm of internal wall space and money on every wall. The new ply products also have higher quality faces which offer a range of finishing opportunities. A natural wood look, a smooth finish for painting or staining.",

MCA impregnation is also different from typical wood preservative treatments, the preservative ingredients are present in microscopic particles which are suspended in water and injected into wood. Any copper that is released into the environment bonds with the soil and becomes biologically inactive.",
      "Another benefit of MCA pressure treated wood is that it is approved for aluminium contact. Always use fasteners that are in accordance with NZS3604; for MCA treated wood used indoors, that means hot-dipped galvanised fasteners, and for all outdoors situations a minimum of 304 stainless steel should be used.",

      "Structural plywood offers a reliable solution for applications requiring long-term load-bearing and structural performance. But distinguishing structural plywood from other types can be essential. In this article, we'll explore what defines structural plywood and how to identify it on-site.",
      "Structural plywood is designed to meet engineering standards and must possess consistent properties to ensure it can safely and reliably bear structural loads over its intended lifespan. Specifications for structural plywood are outlined in AS/NZS 2269.0:2008 Plywood – Structural – Specifications. The structural properties are assessed through machine stress-grading, with 100% of production rigorously examined, or in-grade analysis for products manufactured to precise specifications. Laboratory tests determine crucial properties like modulus of elasticity (MoE), bending strength, shear strength, tension strength, and compression strength, with in-mill verification ensuring ongoing stiffness and strength monitoring. To meet structural requirements, the adhesive used must be durable and creep-resistant, with Type A bond phenolic adhesives proving suitable for long-lasting applications in full exposure.",
      "To identify structural plywood, examine the rear of the sheet for the AS/NZS 2269 standard number, indicating compliance with structural standards. AS/NZS 2269 requires the following markings on the rear of all structural plywood sheets:",
      "Structural plywood finds use in various applications, including flooring, structural bracing, and roofing substrates. Its appeal lies in its consistent performance, ease of workability, and sustainability.",
      "For dry protected applications, structural plywood can meet the New Zealand Building Code's requirement of not less than 50-year durability without treatment. However, when exposed to moisture, such as in exterior cladding, it must be treated to at least timber treatment hazard class H3 to meet Building Code durability standards.",
      "It's crucial to differentiate between plywood and structural plywood. Non-structural plywood should not be substituted for structural plywood, as doing so may lead to structural failure and eventual collapse.",
      "Designers must specify both the plywood hazard class and the preservative treatment to ensure the correct material is used. Hazard classes, listed in NZS 3602:2003, should be selected with care. Some plywood applications require specific preservative treatments, like waterborne preservatives for membrane-roofing substrates, and specifying the correct treatment is vital to prevent compatibility issues and ensure structural integrity.",
      "In summary, structural plywood is a reliable choice for projects demanding long-term structural performance. Understanding its characteristics and how to identify it can help ensure the safety and integrity of your construction projects.",
      "Form plywood is specifically manufactured for use in making concrete forms.",
      "Interior plywood lining is easy to use, comes in a range of profiles, wood types and colours that help homeowners and designers create amazing finishes.",
      "Exterior cladding plywood can be an inexpensive way to clad a house or other lightweight structures or to add accents to a design.",
      "Plywood is one of the most popular flooring sheet products as has excellent strength and bracing properties and is easy to install and maintain.",
      "Roofing Plywood is a structural grade plywood with a plastic tongue and groove down the long edge of the sheet for easy joining over roof trusses.",
      "Only structurally tested plywood has a strength rating. Any ply without a strength rating is considered “non-structural”.",
      "As the name suggests marine plywood is primarily used for boat building, where its superior qualities of strength, consistency and impact resistance have made it the “go to” material for decades.",

It works by trapping pockets of air between the fibres, creating a barrier that reduces heat transfer. One of the key advantages of fibreglass insulation is its versatility. It can be installed in walls, ceilings, and underfloor to enhance energy efficiency and maintain a comfortable indoor environment. Additionally, fibreglass insulation is fire-resistant and does not absorb moisture, preventing mould and mildew growth. Its durability and cost-effectiveness further contribute to its widespread use, making it a reliable and efficient solution for enhancing thermal performance in buildings. At PlaceMakers we offer Pink Batts insulation and Eliment inulsation in our Fibreglass range.",

      "We’re not just the shaky isles, we’re the windy isles. House frames move in high wind zones, so wall linings need to have a certain amount of extra bracing. The Building Code NZ3604:2011 specifies the minimum bracing capacity for wind and earthquakes. The bracing demand to resist wind is expressed in Bracing Units or B/Us per lineal metre or per square metre for earthquakes. Architects and engineers refer to tables to calculate the correct bracing application for each build, bearing mind its structure, location, and orientation.",
      "Gib board changed the game by getting consent for the inherent bracing properties of Gib included in the bracing calculations. This meant fewer additional fixings and fastenings were required in the build, saving construction time and money. But it only applied to Gib. Even if plywood was used, you still needed to gib behind the ply to meet building standards.",
      "Now there’s an improved range of bracing ply that meets the bracing units required to pass consent. You no longer need to gib behind the ply, so you can save time, 10mm of internal wall space and money on every wall.

      "Explore our wide range of accessories to support your building wrap construction including strappings (to hold your wrap in place), penetration seals (to provide air and water resistance for pipes/cables) and quality fixings (caps, nails, clouts, liquid glues & staples) to\nincrease the holding power of your wrap or barrier.",
      "NB: Please ensure you purchase the tools and accessories recommended by the manufacturer.",
      "Penetration seals are designed to multi-fit pipe and cable wall penetrations to create an air and water-resistant barrier as part of your building envelope solution. Simple to install and usually requiring no special tools, glue or tapes they adhere to a wide range of substrates.",
      "Building barrier systems are supplied with fixings and fastenings which are specifically designed for their use. Used to properly secure your barrier in place, fixings ensure structural integrity and contributes to the overall safety and longevity of the building while mitigating risks of failure or compromise due to inadequate fastening.",
      "Strappings engineered for building barrier systems are integral for securely fastening and reinforcing critical components of the barrier structure. Designed specifically for each system, these strappings provide robust support and structural reinforcement enhancing the strength and stability of the building barrier. Ideal for large wall applications, our tough woven and coated straps will hold non-self-supporting roof underlays in place and ensure insulation is restricted without bellowing. Made from a high tensile polythene these straps are easy to use from a hand-held dispenser.",
      "Tools crafted for building barrier systems are designed to streamline the installation process and ensure precise implementation of various barrier components. Tailored to meet the unique requirements of each system, these tools are essential for effective installation of your chosen barrier. Make sure you use the products specifically intended for use with your underlay system. E.g. If you have purchased the James Hardie RAB Boards use their trademark James Hardie knife and JH Blade Saw to deliver a fast clean cut and reduce dust.",

Metal screws have a blunt-looking drill point in comparison to a wood screw's sharp point. You will also see that the screw threads are closer together.",

      "Okahu Villas is a premium micro-neighborhood development located at Tautari St in Orakei, Auckland. Developed by NZB Homes, it comprises 11 high-end homes - 6 standalone, 2 duplexes, and 3 terraced homes, each with 3-4 bedrooms.",
      "Situated on a large north-east facing site, Okahu Villas enjoys a prime location within walking distance to the waterfront. The developer NZB Homes' vision was to create a suburban coastal haven where residents could maximize family downtime while minimizing travel time.",
      "The exterior design makes striking use of two key materials - Thermally Modified Timber (TMT) and Alaskan Yellow Cedar, both sourced from JCS. The TMT® was painted in a dark tone to provide contrast, while the natural warmth of the Yellow Cedar added depth.",
      "The JCS TMT® selection supplied by PlaceMakers' Southeast hub is an innovative, efficient, and environmentally-friendly timber solution. The thermal modification process results in an exceptionally durable, stable material of superior quality while having low environmental impact.",
      "The Alaskan Yellow Cedar complements the TMT perfectly. Naturally resistant to decay, water, and impact damage, it is an ideal exterior material, especially for coastal environments. Its consistent texture and density make it easy to work with and finish while holding coatings and treatments well.",
      "Both the TMT and Alaskan Yellow Cedar were strategically chosen for their versatility, durability, aesthetics, and environmental credentials suiting New Zealand's climate. They complement each other to accentuate the form of the homes, with volumes brought forward or back to create facade depth and enhance the verticality of these impressive three-story homes.",
      "PlaceMakers' Southeast Hub also supplied the frame and trusses, mid-floors, Kwila decking, building wraps and many other key materials for this project. Working closely with the PlaceMakers SFI team, they helped make the client's vision happen.",

      "By incorporating the insulation panel within permanent formwork that remains in place after the concrete has been poured, QuickSet has simplified and improved the build process for foundations, as there’s no stripping of formwork or removal of external bracing required.",
      "The formwork is composed of a PVC foam sheet, laminated with extruded polystyrene (XPS) to add further insulation. This tough, dense material has high impact strength, absorbs less than 1% moisture and is self-extinguishing, making it the perfect material for the outside of a foundation.",
      "Suitable for framing that is 90mm, 140mm, or more, the QuickSet system is highly adaptable and compatible with all pod systems and meets all requirements under H1 regulations. This tried-and-tested system is ready for the building industry to use and is code marked and BRANZ-appraised with Superslab+ by Allied Concrete.",
      "In 2024, QuickSet launched QuickEdge edge insulation for concrete foundations, tailored for those who prefer tried-and-tested traditional boxing methods but seek the advancements of modern solutions.",
      "QuickEdge is a cost-effective edge insulation solution for foundations and is designed to be used in conjunction with traditional formwork. While the concrete slab edge insulation was already available as part of its patented Quickset system, this option provides the benefits of edge insulation to those using traditional concrete slab methods.",
      "QuickEdge is proudly CodeMark-certified and BRANZ-appraised in conjunction with Allied Superslab+.",
      "QuickEdge has three options to suit varying traditional slab methods, and all deliver superior thermal performance:",
      "Designed to deliver exceptional performance at an affordable pricepoint, QuickEdge is pre-finished with UV stabilisers built into it and does not require plastering, priming or painting – saving time and labour costs.",
      "With durability in mind, QuickEdge is built to survive the rigours of construction and the bustling activity of home life. Thanks to a dense outer layer protecting the softer insulation material on the inside, there should be no accidental damage from weed eaters, lawn mowers or cricket balls!"

From there, we take care of it with proper storage and attention to detail in our delivery practices to ensure your timber arrives just right.",
      "H1.2 timber is used for framing applications where exposure to moisture is minimal. Treated for protection against decay and insect attack, this timber is kiln-dried to ensure low moisture content, which helps prevent warping and enhances stability. The kiln-drying process removes excess moisture, making H1.2 timber less prone to movement and more reliable for structural use. Whether you're working on an enclosed wall framing, roofing or even building an internal partition wall, Kiln dried H1.2 timber from PlaceMakers offers consistent quality and durability.",
      "H3.2 timber is designed to handle the demands of outdoor and high-moisture environments, making it a good choice for framing and structural applications exposed to the elements. Treated to withstand decay and insect attack, this H3.2 timber is kiln-dried, a process that reduces moisture content to improve stability and prevent warping. This ensures the timber maintains its strength and integrity over time and provides more stability than the alternative wet H3.2 timber. Perfect for projects such as decking, pergolas, and retaining walls. We stock kiln dried H3.2 in a range of sizes including the popular 140x45mm.",
      "Wet H3.2 timber is treated to withstand outdoor conditions and high-moisture environments, making it a robust choice for various exterior construction projects. Unlike kiln-dried timber, wet H3.2 timber retains a higher moisture content, which can be advantageous for certain applications where initial moisture levels are necessary for proper setting and bonding. Treated to resist decay and insect attack, wet H3.2 timber is suitable for framing in environments exposed to the elements, such as decking, retaining walls, and pergolas. Its treatment ensures long-lasting performance and durability, even in demanding outdoor conditions.",

      "With wall framing now requiring a construction R-value of 2.0, PlaceMakers Frame and Truss is committed to helping builders achieve – and exceed – the new regulation in the best way possible. Under the banner of Framology, it has developed two innovative solutions",
      "Timber is an excellent and easy-to-use sustainable building material that PlaceMakers Frame and Truss plants around New Zealand have been supplying to builders for decades. Due to thermal bridging, there is a direct correlation between the actual construction R-value and how much timber is within the wall framing. Thermal bridges are materials or elements that are better at conducting heat.",
      "When MBIE introduced the requirement that all walls in New Zealand, regardless of zone, achieve R2.0 as part of its updates to Building Code Clause H1 Energy Efficiency, it carried over the definition of construction R-value for a typical area of wall from the previous Standard to H1/AS1 2.1.4.3. This means that thermal bridging due to studs, nogs/dwangs, top plates and bottom plates is taken into account, but thermal bridging due to lintels, sills, the additional studs that support them, and studs at corners and junctions, is not.",
      "In a bid to better understand the actual timber to exterior wall framing ratio – including all timber – BRANZ and Beacon Pathways conducted a study. Released in 2020, it found the actual percentage was between 24% and 57%, with an average of 34%, when accounting for all timber within the wall frame.",
      "To showcase the difference it makes when all timber is taken into account, BRANZ highlighted the following examples.",
      "With a framing ratio of 43% (taking all timber into account), using R2.0 insulation in 90mm framing will only achieve an actual R-value of R1.44, and using R2.8 insulation will only achieve an actual R-value of R1.57.",
      "With a framing ratio of 23% (taking all timber into account), using R2.0 insulation in 90mm framing will only achieve an actual R-value of R1.79, and using R2.8 insulation will only just achieve an actual R-value of R2.0.",
      "As a result, many in the industry are suggesting using 140mm framing, which is deeper and can therefore accommodate thicker insulation with a higher product R-value – a solution the Framology team doesn’t believe is necessary.",
      "As National Technical Resource Manager Pete Hammond succinctly put it: “While using 140mm framing in external walls allows space for a higher performing insulation, it increases the cost and complexity. We wanted to find a solution for those who would still prefer to use 90mm framing, but also want to work toward achieving an actual R-value of R2.0 when taking all timber into account – not just the timber specified to be included in the construction R-value required in H1.",
      "“I strongly believe this is possible in most instances.”",
      "To help designers, builders and homeowners achieve this, the Framology team developed a two-step solution. Firstly, the amount of timber stipulated in a build is reported through the Timber Percentage Report, and secondly Framology has developed a building method that will reduce that amount. That method is nog’less sheathed framing.",
      "The first of its kind in the market, PlaceMakers Framology Timber Percentage Report is used to determine the timber to wall area percentage. Based on the design that would normally be provided to PlaceMakers Frame and Truss for a quote, the report includes:",
      "Released in September 2023, more than 1,000 reports have already been provided to designers and builders.",
      "The second step in the process – nog’less sheathed framing – was released to market in February. Several builds are already under way and one has been completed (see image). While the concept of reducing or removing nogs – the horizontal blocking pieces used between the wall studs – isn’t new, PlaceMakers Frame and Truss is the first large-scale operation to execute the concept.",
      "“Removing nogging that’s not needed reduces the overall timber percentage by about 4%, which can make quite a difference to thermal bridging,” says Pete.",
      "“Then we sheath it with RigidRAP-XT®, an insulated rigid air barrier with a product R-value of R0.41. Combined with an R2.8 insulation product, this approach will achieve a true R2.0 construction value in 90mm framing in most scenarios.”",
      "While PlaceMakers promotes using RigidRAP-XT®, the nog’less framing can be sheathed with other rigid air barriers, such as EcoPly, upon request, or can even be provided to site as standalone framing – it just requires careful handling.",
      "People have been questioning the purpose of nogs/dwangs for decades. The first study suggesting that the practice of nogging was unnecessary was published by MJ Collins in 1974, followed by several BRANZ studies (1991, 1998 and 2011) and BRANZ guidance (2020).",
      "Most other countries eliminated the practice decades years ago, when kiln-dried timber became commonplace, but Kiwis have held onto the traditional building method. In its BRANZ Beacon Pathways study, BRANZ suggested the additional framing could have a number of origins including:",
      "“People have been questioning the purpose of nogging for more than 40 years, so it’s about time we applied that tried and tested logic,” says Pete. “We look forward to helping our customers build houses without unnecessary thermal bridges that compromise energy efficiency.”"

In this article, we highlight a new solution from Comfortech®, developed in collaboration with PlaceMakers Framology team",
      "Timber is an excellent and easy-to-use sustainable building material that PlaceMakers Frame and Truss plants around New Zealand have been supplying to builders for decades. Due to thermal bridging, there is a direct correlation between the actual construction R-value and amount of timber within the wall framing. Thermal bridges have higher thermal conductivity than surrounding materials, creating a path of least resistance for heat transfer.",
      "In the previous issue of Under Construction, we featured an innovative two-step solution from PlaceMakers Framology for reporting and reducing the amount of timber required – nog’less sheathed framing. But framing is only part of the solution. The insulation used between the frames also plays a significant role in reducing heat loss, which is why the PlaceMakers Framology team is partnering with insulation providers – such as Comfortech® – to deliver comprehensive solutions.",
      "Over the past few months, the Framology team has worked closely with Comfortech® on nog’less battened framing, which combines a new ‘Secondary Insulation Layer Wall Solution’ from Comfortech® with Framology’s nog’less framing to deliver better outcomes.",
      "In May 2023, MBIE introduced the fifth edition of H1/AS1 and H1/VM1 for housing and H1/AS2 or H1/VM2 for buildings greater than 300m². These changes focus on significant increases to insulation requirements and the introduction of six new climate zones to reflect the specific weather experienced in different parts of the country, helping to keep New Zealand homes and buildings warmer, drier, and healthier.",
      "This includes significant changes to insulation requirements in ceilings; however, there have been minimal changes to wall requirements.",
      "“Professionals within the building industry have expressed concerns around the risk of over insulating our ceilings, the source of around 40% of heat loss, while not properly addressing the 20% of heat loss in walls,” says Comfortech® Building Performance and Technical Manager Todd Lindsay.",
      "“To address this imbalance, solutions are needed to provide substantive increases in wall R-values. In turn, this would allow us, under the Calculation or Modelling method, to reduce the R-value of our ceilings – particularly in the milder climate zones – and deliver balanced, energy-efficient, more comfortable homes, year-round.",
      "“At Comfortech®, we are dedicated to delivering better performing buildings to meet our climate goal commitments and to deliver on our purpose of creating New Zealand’s most comfortable living and working spaces,” says Lindsay. “The industry cannot just pivot to 140mm framing, due to capacity constraints and practical considerations – therefore innovation is required.”",
      "To support the industry, Comfortech® has developed a Secondary Layer Wall solution, which utilises the delivery of a 90mm timber frame wall, with a secondary insulation between 45mm thickness internal battens – as illustrated in Figure 1. This solution delivers a thermal performance that exceeds the thermal performance of a 140mm R4.0 Pink® Batts® by around 21%, while avoiding supply constraints and additional costs, and also maintaining the bracing performance of the internal lining.",
      "A 90mm frame wall with 30% framing and R2.8 Pink® Batts®, with a secondary insulation layer of R1.3 between 45mm battens, will achieve a construction R value of R3.2, versus a 140mm wall frame with R4.0 Pink® Batts®, which only achieves a construction value of R2.65 with the same 30% framing. The bracing value of the plasterboard can still be utilised.",
      "“As the business that brought edge compression to avoid raised heels, and which is continuing to drive consideration around perimeter ventilation of roof spaces, we are committed to delivering market-leading performance in residential walls,” says Lindsay.",
      "More information on the Comfortech® Secondary Insulation Layer Wall Solution can be found under ‘wall insulation solutions’ on its ‘H1 Done’ hub at H1done.co.nz .",
      "Knowing its commitment to providing solutions that meet increased thermal performance requirements, Comfortech® approached PlaceMakers Framology team about collaborating on a solution that combines Framology’s nog’less framing with a Comfortech® secondary insulation layer. They were welcomed with open arms and minds by the team and its solution-driven manager, PlaceMakers Frame and Truss National Technical Resource Manager Pete Hammond.",
      "“This is an ideal option for homeowners, who aren’t looking to use a rigid air barrier,” explains Pete. “While the battens required could be fitted on site, doing it in the factory and delivering a combined solution direct to site actually saves the builder and homeowner time and money.”",
      "Pete, whose team doesn’t believe the industry hype that suggests using 140mm framing, which is deeper and can therefore accommodate thicker insulation with a higher product R-value, is necessary, is thrilled to have yet another solution for builders and their clients.",
      "“While using 140mm framing in external walls allows space for a higher-performing insulation, it increases the cost and complexity. We continue our commitment to finding a solution for those who would still prefer to use 90mm framing, but also want to work toward achieving higher R values.",
      "“We are pleased to collaborate with Comfortech® on this and, in the process, add another string to our timber framing bow.”"

From the time it leaves CHH Woodproducts, until the time the frame is enclosed on the building site, there are many opportunities for the timber to be exposed to moisture. Moisture exposure can lead to high moisture readings and slow your job site down.",

      "Remember, it’s important to keep timber dry to prevent moisture-related defects so, if the product does get wet – dry it out!",
      "Step 1:The only appropriate moisture meter to be used on site is the ‘sliding hammer’ type, which is a resistance meter with insulated long prongs (30 mm). To use a capacitance meter or another type will almost certainly give false readings.",
      "Step 2:Use insulated electrodes only. Tip: If the meter has not been used for some time, check it against the test card. Ensure that the meter is calibrated annually.",
      "Step 3:Thoroughly check the meter and make sure that the batteries are charged and the electrodes are in good working order and correctly connected.",
      "Step 4:Insert the insulated probes to approximately one-third the thickness of the timber, parallel to the grain, and at least 500 mm from an end of the timber.",
      "Step 5:Test the areas of framing to which internal linings are installed, such as wall framing, rafters, ceiling battens and floor joists.",
      "Step 6:Read and record the moisture content percentage of each individual piece of timber identified to be sampled with at least half the samples taken in areas of restricted drying. Increase sampling proportionally for larger buildings.",
      "Step 7:Carefully remove the probes without bending them. Use the sliding hammer attached to the longer probes.",

      "Beginning from May 2026, all newly installed copper-alloy (brass) products are required to contain less than 0.25% lead, in accordance with updated regulatory standards. Additionally, any tapware installed must not only be lead-free but also dezincification resistant (DZR), ensuring greater safety and durability over time. In preparation for these changes, PlaceMakers has already begun transitioning its product range, with the newly compliant items clearly identified by “LF” or “Lead-Free” markings or labels on both packaging and the products themselves. You will notice these already starting to appear in our shelves and bins.",
      "To support this shift and to ensure full compliance with the products that we supply you as of May 1st next year, PlaceMakers will stop accepting returns of non-lead-free products from November 1st, 2025. We will have this clearly signposted in our branches to remind you. We suggest that you only take the product that you need for the job. (see FAQ’s below for exceptions to the new regulations)",
      "The production of lead-free products incurs higher manufacturing costs, however PlaceMakers is committed to offering these items at the same price as their current equivalents. In most cases, we have been able to keep pricing the same.",

      "Yes. If a building consent was applied for or issued before the 1st May 2026, then the product that was deemed as compliant prior to the 1st May 2026 is fit for purpose.",
      "It has been internationally accepted that when the lead content is less than 0.25%, it is referred to as Lead-Free. PlaceMakers was keen to call this Low lead, however, this would have led to confusion as our suppliers are using the internationally accepted term “Lead-Free”.",
